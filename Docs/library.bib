abstract = {In this work, a method is presented to extend the convolutional perfectly matched layer (C-PML) to simulate acoustic wave propagation in elastic media with a second-order equation formulation. This non-physical layer is used at the computational edge of a finite element method algorithm in frequency domain, and a pseudo-spectral algorithm in time domain, as an absorbing boundary condition (ABC) to truncate unbounded media. Numerical results show that the C-PML ABC attenuates the outgoing surface waves more effectively than classical PML ABC as proposed by Berenger [J. Comput. Phys. 114, 195-200 (1994)] for electromagnetic waves in the case of oblique incidence, where the PML method suffers from large spurious reflections. Moreover, a modification of the proposed C-PML formulation is also discussed in order to stabilize the absorbing layer in anisotropic solids where numerical instabilities can appear.},

abstract = {Rife (RPG Diffusor Systems, 651-C Commerce Drive, Upper Marlboro, MD 20774) pdantonio@rpginc.com and brife@rpginc.com For over 100 years, the acoustical industry has measured and characterized sound absorption. And yet, standard meas-urements of the random incidence absorption coefficient, according to ISO 354 and ASTM C423-09, are still inaccurate and lack reproducibility among labs. All measurements and predictions rely on the concept of a diffuse sound field, which is yet to be fully characterized in the standards. Research is underway to improve accuracy by replacing traditional hang-ing diffusors with boundary mounted diffusors, to allow proper determination of the rev room's surface area and volume, evaluating edge diffraction, replacing Sabine with Eyring, etc.. Calibration methods using an absorptive or reflective refer-ence are also being evaluated to improve reproducibility. This author favors the use of a reflective reference, as this is cur-rently being used in ISO 179497-1 and ISO 17497-2 and reproducibility is found to be quite good at various scales among different labs. The field of measuring and characterizing scattered sound is in its infancy by comparison, yet in the past three decades much progress has been made. Two standards have emerged for measuring scattering (ISO 17497-1) and diffusion (ISO-17497-2) and the current state of the art for both will be reviewed. While much progress has been made in measuring and characterizing scattering surfaces, we still need to develop a relationship between these material metrics and a room property, which we can call diffusivity. This paper is intended to be a tutorial on the evolution and current state of the art.},

abstract = {An index known as leachate pollution index (LPI) for quantifying the leachate contamination potential of municipal landfills had been developed and reported by the authors. It is a quantitative tool by which the leachate pollution data of landfill sites can be reported uniformly. LPI is an increasing scale index and has been formulated based on the Delphi technique. It provides a convenient means of summarizing complex leachate pollution data and facilitates its communication to the general public, field professionals and policy makers. However, it is observed that the LPI, like any other environmental index, fails to effectively communicate the details about the strength of various pollutants/pollutant groups present. In an effort to make the LPI more informative and useful, it is proposed to divide the LPI into three sub-indices. The aggregation of these three sub-LPIs will result in the overall LPI. The formulation and the application of LPI and its three sub-indices are presented in this paper. It has been concluded that the splitting of LPI into three sub-indices provides a better insight on the strength of various pollutants and can be useful to the experts in deciding various management issues regarding leachate treatment. The leachate characteristics of a UK landfill have been used as a case study to demonstrate the calculation of three sub-LPIs and the overall LPI.},

abstract = {The following paper describes a work which sought to revive and investigate the soundscape of a 14th century Abbey. Geometric room acoustic modelling methods were employed to realise this aim and particular attention was given to monitoring the influ- ence of the level of geometrical detailing on acoustical character- istics. Three virtual acoustic models, of varying detail, were con- structed and simulated in order to obtain room impulse responses which were then harnessed for analysis and the creation of au- ralizations. The results given in this document were obtained through direct examination of impulse responses gathered and subjective testing. Reverberation times were shown to be more or less consistent at high frequencies in all three models and in- creasingly dissimilar as frequency decreases. Subjective testing was employed to gain insight into the audibility of the contrast in acoustical qualities possessed by each model. The conclusions drawn from analysis are, in part, supported by the subjective test- ing results},

These methods, in contrast to more common finite-difference, time-domain approaches, provide isotropic dispersion characteristics. However, the technical literature concerning to this topic presents a serious lack of methods for dealing with partially reflecting boundary conditions in order to simulate surfaces of a specified impedance. In the current paper we present a novel semi-empirical formulation for simulating constant impedance boundary conditions within Pseudo-Spectral techniques based on the Fourier transform.

We develop such a scheme based on a simple criterion taken from perturbation theory and compare it with other published FDTD smoothing methods.

abstract = {The perfectly matched layer {\~{}}PML! was first introduced by Berenger as a material absorbing boundary condition (ABC) for electromagnetic waves. It was first proven by Chew and Liu that a fictitious elastic PML half-space also exists in solids, which completely absorbs elastic waves, in spite of the coupling between compressional and shear waves. The PML absorbing boundary condition provides much higher absorption than other previous ABCs in finite-difference methods. In this work, a method is presented to extend the perfectly matched layer to simulating acoustic wave propagation in absorptive media. This nonphysical material is used at the computational edge of a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm as an ABC to truncate unbounded media. Two aspects of the acoustic PML are distinct: {\~{}}a! For a perfectly matched layer in an intrinsically absorptive medium, an additional term involving the time-integrated pressure field has to be introduced to account for the coupling between the loss from the PML and the normal absorptive loss; {\~{}}b! In contrast to the full elastodynamic problem, the acoustic PML requires a splitting only on the pressure field, but not on the particle velocity field. The FDTD algorithm is validated by analytical solutions and other numerical results for two- and three-dimensional problems. Unlike the previous ABCs, the PML ABC effectively absorbs outgoing waves at the computational edge even when a dipping interface intersects the outer boundary},

@article{Schneider1998c,
abstract = {The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is a simple but powerful numerical method which has been used to perform a wide variety of complex simulations. One of the considerations in using this method is modeling the source of the incident field. When the physical source of acoustic energy is located within the FDTD grid it has typically been modeled as a ‘‘hard'' source for which a source function determines the field at a source node. One drawback of a hard source is that it acts itself as a scatterer. Moreover, its scattering cross section is dictated by the spatial step size within the grid; thus, scattering is independent of the underlying physical size of the source. In this paper a scheme is presented that permits the creation of completely transparent sources. These sources, although more expensive to implement than traditional hard sources, radiate the same field as a hard source, but do not scatter energy.},

Also, the image model can provide insight into the fundamental acoustical properties of different concert hall geometries. For example, the extended image model demonstrates that rectangular halls have an advantage over fan-shaped halls with regard to spatial impression. We also show why the image model has fundamental advantages over another popular modeling technique, ray tracing.},

@misc{Strogatz1994,
abstract = {This textbook is aimed at newcomers to nonlinear dynamics and chaos, especially students taking a first course in the subject. The presentation stresses analytical methods, concrete examples and geometric intuition. The theory is developed systematically, starting with first-order differential equations and their bifurcations, followed by phase plane analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations, and culminating with the Lorenz equations, chaos, iterated maps, period doubling, renormalization, fractals, and strange attractors.A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on applications. These include mechanical vibrations, lasers, biological rhythms, superconducting circuits, insect outbreaks, chemical oscillators, genetic control systems, chaotic waterwheels, and even a technique for using chaos to send secret messages. In each case, the scientific background is explained at an elementary level and closely integrated with the mathematical theory.Richly illustrated, and with many exercises and worked examples, this book is ideal for an introductory course at the junior/senior or first-year graduate level. It is also ideal for the scientist who has not had formal instruction in nonlinear dynamics, but who now desires to begin informal study. The prerequisites are multivariable calculus and introductory physics.},

abstract = {An extended Fourier pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method is presented to model atmospheric sound propagation by solving the linearized Euler equations. In this method, evaluation of spatial derivatives is based on an eigenfunction expansion. Evaluation on a spatial grid requires only two spatial points per wavelength. Time iteration is done using a low-storage optimized six-stage Runge-Kutta method. This method is applied to two-dimensional non-moving media models, one with screens and one for an urban canyon, with generally high accuracy in both amplitude and phase. For a moving atmosphere, accurate results have been obtained in models with both a uniform and a logarithmic wind velocity profile over a rigid ground surface and in the presence of a screen. The method has also been validated for three-dimensional sound propagation over a screen. For that application, the developed method is in the order of 100 times faster than the second-order-accurate FDTD solution to the linearized Euler equations. The method is found to be well suited for atmospheric sound propagation simulations where effects of complex meteorology and straight rigid boundary surfaces are to be investigated.},

As a direct time-domain simulation, suitable for large modeling regions, the technique seems a good "brute force" approach for solving room acoustic problems. Some attention is paid in this paper to a few of the key problems involved in applying FDTD: frequency-dependent boundary conditions, non-Cartesian grids, and numerical error. Possible applications are illustrated with an example. An interesting approach lies in using the FDTD simulation to adapt a digital filter to represent the acoustical transfer function from source to observer, as accurately as possible. The approximate digital filter can be used for auralization experiments. ¸ 1995 Acoustical Society of America. PACS},

abstract = {A single room impulse response can reveal information about the acoustics of a given space in both objective, and, when used for auralization, subjective terms. However, for additional spatial information, or more accurate and perceptually convincing auralization, multiple impulse responses are needed. Higher order Ambisonics is a robust means of capturing the spatial qualities of an acoustic space over multiple channels for decoding and rendering over many possible speaker layouts. A method for obtaining {\$}N{\$}th-order Ambisonic impulse responses from a room acoustic model, based on lower orders using differential microphone techniques is presented. This is tested using a third-order encoding of a 2-D finite difference time domain room acoustic simulation based on multiple circular arrays of receivers. Accurate channel directional profiles are obtained and results are verified in a series of listening tests comparing the localization of a sound source placed within the given simulation to the same source encoded directly. This generic encoding scheme can be applied to any room acoustic simulation technique where it is possible to obtain impulse responses across multiple receiver positions. Although the proposed method encompasses horizontal encoding only, it can also be applied directly in 3-D simulations where height information is not required in the final auralization.},

abstract = {When a sound producing device such as insert earphones or a hearing aid is sealed in the ear canal, the fact that only a tiny segment of the sound wave can exist in this small volume at any given instant, produces an oscillation of the static pressure in the ear canal. This effect can greatly boosts the SPL in the ear canal, especially at low frequencies, a phenomena which we call Trapped Volume Insertion Gain (TVIG). In this study the TVIG has been found by numerical modeling as well as direct measurements using a Zwislocki coupler and the ear of a human subject, to be as much as 50dB greater than sound pressures typically generated while listening to sounds in an open environment. Even at moderate listening volumes, the TVIG can increase the low frequency SPL in the ear canal to levels where they produce excursions of the tympanic membrane that are 100 to 1000 times greater than in normal open-ear hearing. Additionally, the high SPL at low frequencies in the trapped volume of the ear canal, can easily exceed the threshold necessary to trigger the Stapedius reflex, a stiffing response of the middle ear, which reduces its sensitivity, and may lead to audio fatigue. The addition of a compliant membrane covered vent in the sound tube of an insert ear tip was found to reduce the TVIG by up to 20 dB, such that the Stapedius reflex would likely not be triggered.},

abstract = {To increase the survival rates of patients with breast cancer, an ultrasound imaging system must detect tumors when they are small, with a diameter of 5 mm or less. This requires an understanding of how propagation of ultrasound energy is affected by the complex structure of the breast. In this paper, a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method is developed to simulate ultrasound propagation in a two-dimensional model of the human breast. The FDTD simulations make it possible to better understand the behavior of an ultrasound signal in the breast. For example, here the simulations are used to investigate the effect of fat lobes adjacent to the skin layer in a simple breast model. Experimental work performed at the University of Pennsylvania has shown that strong refraction caused by the fat lobes results in nulls in the forward transmitted field. This result was duplicated with the FDTD simulations, and it was shown that the effect of refraction is clearly evident for energy exiting the breast. The existence of strong refraction has a significant impact on ultrasound imaging since it implies that an imaging method based on a weak scattering assumption is unlikely to work well.},

abstract = {The Woodworth model and formula for interaural time difference is frequently used as a standard in physiological and psychoacoustical studies of binaural hearing for humans and other animals. It is a frequency-independent, ray-tracing model of a rigid spherical head that is expected to agree with the high-frequency limit of an exact diffraction model. The predictions by the Woodworth model for antipodal ears and for incident plane waves are here compared with the predictions of the exact model as a function of frequency to quantify the discrepancy when the frequency is not high. In a second calculation, the Woodworth model is extended to arbitrary ear angles, both for plane-wave incidence and for finite point-source distance. The extended Woodworth model leads to different formulas in six different regions defined by ear angle and source distance. It is noted that the characteristic cusp in Woodworth{\{}{\&}{\}}apos;s well-known function comes from ignoring the longer of the two paths around the head in circumstances when the longer path is actually important. This error can be readily corrected.},

abstract = {Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods suffer from reduced accuracy when modeling discontinuous dielectric materials, due to the inhererent discretization (pixelization). We show that accuracy can be significantly improved by using a subpixel smoothing of the dielectric function, but only if the smoothing scheme is properly designed. We develop such a scheme based on a simple criterion taken from perturbation theory and compare it with other published FDTD smoothing methods. In addition to consistently achieving the smallest errors, our scheme is the only one that attains quadratic convergence with resolution for arbitrarily sloped interfaces. Finally, we discuss additional difficulties that arise for sharp dielectric corners.},

abstract = {An open source implementation of the Fourier pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method for computing the propagation of sound is presented, which is geared towards applications in the built environment. Being a wave-based method, PSTD captures phenomena like diffraction, but maintains efficiency in processing time and memory usage as it allows to spatially sample close to the Nyquist criterion, thus keeping both the required spatial and temporal resolution coarse. In the implementation it has been opted to model the physical geometry as a composition of rectangular two-dimensional subdomains, hence initially restricting the implementation to orthogonal and two-dimensional situations. The strategy of using subdomains divides the problem domain into local subsets, which enables the simulation software to be built according to Object-Oriented Programming best practices and allows room for further computational parallelization. The software is built using the open source components, Blender, Numpy and Python, and has been published under an open source license itself as well. For accelerating the software, an option has been included to accelerate the calculations by a partial implementation of the code on the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU), which increases the throughput by up to fifteen times. The details of the implementation are reported, as well as the accuracy of the code.

abstract = {An extended Fourier pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method is presented to model atmospheric sound propagation by solving the linearized Euler equations. In this method, evaluation of spatial derivatives is based on an eigenfunction expansion. Evaluation on a spatial grid requires only two spatial points per wavelength. Time iteration is done using a low-storage optimized six-stage Runge-Kutta method. This method is applied to two-dimensional non-moving media models, one with screens and one for an urban canyon, with generally high accuracy in both amplitude and phase. For a moving atmosphere, accurate results have been obtained in models with both a uniform and a logarithmic wind velocity profile over a rigid ground surface and in the presence of a screen. The method has also been validated for three-dimensional sound propagation over a screen. For that application, the developed method is in the order of 100 times faster than the second-order-accurate FDTD solution to the linearized Euler equations. The method is found to be well suited for atmospheric sound propagation simulations where effects of complex meteorology and straight rigid boundary surfaces are to be investigated.},

abstract = {The Fourier pseudospectral time-domain method is an efficient wave-based method to model sound propagation in inhomogeneous media. One of the limitations of the method for atmospheric sound propagation purposes is its restriction to a Cartesian grid, confining it to staircase-like geometries. A transform from the physical coordinate system to the curvilinear coordinate system has been applied to solve more arbitrary geometries. For applicability of this method near the boundaries, the acoustic velocity variables are solved for their curvilinear components. The performance of the curvilinear Fourier pseudospectral method is investigated in free field and for outdoor sound propagation over an impedance strip for various types of shapes. Accuracy is shown to be related to the maximum grid stretching ratio and deformation of the boundary shape and computational efficiency is reduced relative to the smallest grid cell in the physical domain. The applicability of the curvilinear Fourier pseudospectral time-domain method is demonstrated by investigating the effect of sound propagation over a hill in a nocturnal boundary layer. With the proposed method, accurate and efficient results for sound propagation over smoothly varying ground surfaces with high impedances can be obtained.},

Conventional methods for the assessment of room acoustics model the sound propagation in analogy to the propagation of light. More advanced computational methods rely on the numerical solution of the wave equation. A recently presented method is based on multidimensional wave digital principles. It allows a physically exact numerical modelling of the relevant acoustical effects and yields robust algorithms. This contribution presents a new foundation of the multidimensional wave digital principle as applied to room acoustics. It starts from the first principles of physics. From there, the derivation of the algorithm only involves basic knowledge of numerical mathematics, linear algebra, and multidimensional system theory.

We discuss the range of parameters in which elastic deformations do not influence the bouncing dynamics of this object and compare this behavior with the bouncing ball dynamics. By calculating the spring bouncing threshold, we evidence the effect of resonance and prove that elastic properties can make the bounce easier. This effect is for example encountered in the case of bouncing droplets. We also consider bifurcation diagrams in order to describe the consequences of a dependence on the frequency.

abstract = {Image methods are commonly used for the analysis of the acoustic properties of enclosures. In this paper we discuss the theoretical and practical use of image techniques for simulating, on a digital computer, the impulse response between two points in a small rectangular room. The resulting impulse response, when convolved with any desired input signal, such as speech, simulates room reverberation of the input signal. This technique is useful in signal processing or psychoacoustic studies. The entire process is carried out on a digital computer so that a wide range of room parameters can be studied with accurate control over the experimental conditions. A fortran implementation of this model has been included.},

abstract = {The Woodworth model and formula for interaural time difference is frequently used as a standard in physiological and psychoacoustical studies of binaural hearing for humans and other animals. It is a frequency-independent, ray-tracing model of a rigid spherical head that is expected to agree with the high-frequency limit of an exact diffraction model. The predictions by the Woodworth model for antipodal ears and for incident plane waves are here compared with the predictions of the exact model as a function of frequency to quantify the discrepancy when the frequency is not high. In a second calculation, the Woodworth model is extended to arbitrary ear angles, both for plane-wave incidence and for finite point-source distance. The extended Woodworth model leads to different formulas in six different regions defined by ear angle and source distance. It is noted that the characteristic cusp in Woodworth{\&}apos;s well-known function comes from ignoring the longer of the two paths around the head in circumstances when the longer path is actually important. This error can be readily corrected.},

abstract = {The first artificial reverberation algorithms were proposed in the early 1960s, and new, improved algorithms are published regularly. These algorithms have been widely used in music production since the 1970s, and now find applications in new fields, such as game audio. This overview article provides a unified review of the various approaches to digital artificial reverberation. The three main categories have been delay networks, convolution-based algorithms, and physical room models. Delay-network and convolution techniques have been competing in popularity in the music technology field, and are often employed to produce a desired perceptual or artistic effect. In applications including virtual reality, predictive acoustic modeling, and computer-aided design of acoustic spaces, accuracy is desired, and physical models have been mainly used, although, due to their computational complexity, they are currently mainly used for simplified geometries or to generate reverberation impulse responses for use with a convolution method. With the increase of computing power, all these approaches will be available in real time. A recent trend in audio technology is the emulation of analog artificial reverberation units, such as spring reverberators, using signal processing algorithms. As a case study we present an improved parametric model for a spring reverberation unit.},

abstract = {An efficient reverberator structure is proposed for approximating measured reverberation. A fixed convolution matching the early portion of a measured impulse response is crossfaded with a switched convolution reverberator drawing its switched convolution section from the late-field of the measured impulse response. In this way, the early portion of the measured impulse response is precisely re- produced, and the late-field equalization and decay rates efficiently approximated. To use segments of the measured impulse response, the switched convolution structure is modified to include a normal- ization filter to account for the decay of the late-field between the nominal fixed/switched crossfade time and the time of the selected segment. Further, the measured impulse response late-field is ex- tended below its noise floor in anticipation of the normalization. This structure provides psychoacoustically accurate synthesis of the measured impulse response using less than half a second of convolution, irrespective of the length of the measured impulse re- sponse. In addition, the structure provides direct control over the equalization and late-field frequency dependent decay rate. Emu- lations of EMT 140 plate reverberator and marble lobby impulse responses are presented.},

abstract = {Inthis paper, we are investigating the potential and limits ofa meshless Lagrangian technique, called Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), asa method for acoustic simulations. Currently the most common techniquesfor acoustic simulations draw on mesh-based methods such as theBoundary Element Method (BEM), Finite Differences Method (FD) and FiniteElement Method (FEM). Though many improvements have been made toeach class of methods during the last few years, theystill have their weaknesses. Difficulties arise as soon as inhomogeneousmedia, moving boundaries or aeroacoustic effects are involved. These problemsare either particularly hard to describe or cannot be simulatedwith some of these mesh-based methods. The investigation of SPHfor modeling sound propagation is carried out in order toassess its potential in relation to the limitations associated withthe existing simulation methods listed above. Simple computational experiments willbe carried out for the verification of the new approachand applications on the problems listed above will be discussed. {\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}t{\$}\backslash{\$}t{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}t{\$}\backslash{\$}t{\$}\backslash{\$}t {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}}2009 ASME},

Particular emphasis is given to the properties and calculation of reverberation, the most obvious acoustical feature of a closed room. Further key topics include the mechanisms of sound absorption and psychoacoustical factors, from which design parameters and figures of merit are derived. Two chapters are devoted to practical questions such as measurement techniques and the procedures of room acoustical design. The interaction between a room's acoustic properties and its electroacoustic systems is also considered, and refined systems for optimizing listening conditions in a room are presented. This edition includes a new list of symbols, and updated sections include the measurement of the impulse response including a discussion of distortions, sound propagation as a diffusive process and scattering by wall irregularities.},

abstract = {Previously we described a model for calculating the loudness of steady sou nds from their spectrum. Here a new version of the model is presented, which uses a waveform as its input. The stages of the model are as follows. (a) A finite impulse response filter representing transfer through the outer and middle ear. (b) Calculation of the short-term spectrum using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). To give adequate spectral resolution at low frequencies, combined with adequate temporal resolution at high frequencies, six FFTs are calculated in parallel, using longer signal segments for low frequencies and shorter segments for higher frequencies. (c) Calculation of an excitation pauern from the physical spectrum. (d) Transformation of the excitation pattern to a specific loudness pattern. (e) Determination of the area under the specific loudness pattern. This gives a value for the "instantaneous" loudness. The short-term perceived loudness is calculated from the instantaneous loudness using an averaging mechanism similar to an automatic gain control system, with attack and release times. Finally the overall loudness impression is calculated from the short-term loudness using a similar averaging mechanism, but with longer attack and release times. The new model gives very similar predictions to our earlier model for steady sounds. In addition, it can predict the loudness of brief sounds as a function of duration and the overall loudness of sounds that are amplitude modulated at various rates.},

Using this simple and controlled experimental setup, they were able to make meaningful comparisons between global illumination simulations and photographs of the scene and provide explanations for the differences. Motivated by the Cornell Box's success, we've built a simple experimental setup for validating sound propagation simulations. Our setup, the Bell Labs Box, comprises a simple configuration of planar surfaces with a speaker and a microphone. Although the room's basic configuration is a simple six-sided box, we constructed it with reconfigurable panels that we can insert or remove to create various interesting geometries, including ones with diffracting panels.},

abstract = {The “direct-off-line” switchmode supply is so called because it takes its power input directly from the ac power lines, without using the rather large low-frequency (60 to 50 Hz) isolation transformer normally found in linear power supplies. Although the various switchmode conversion techniques are often very different in terms of circuit design, they have, over many years, developed very similar basic functional characteristics that have become generally accepted industry standards. Further, the need to satisfy various national and international safety, electromagnetic compatibility, and line transient requirements has forced the adoption of relatively standard techniques for track and component spacing, noise filter design, and transient protection. The prudent designer will be familiar with all these agency needs before proceeding with a design. Many otherwise sound designs have failed as a result of their inability to satisfy safety agency standards. Many of the requirements outlined in this section will be common to all switching sup-plies, irrespective of the design strategy or circuit. Although the functions tend to remain the same for all units, the circuit techniques used to obtain them may be quite different. There are many ways of meeting these needs, and there will usually be a best approach for a particular application. The designer must also consider all the minor facets of the specification before decid-ing on a design strategy. Failure to consider at an early stage some very minor system requirement could completely negate a design approach—for example, power good and power failure indicators and signals, which require an auxiliary supply irrespective of the converter action, would completely negate a design approach which does not provide this auxiliary supply when the converter is inhibited! It can often prove to be very difficult to provide for some minor neglected need at the end of the design and development exercise. The remainder of Chap. 1 gives an overview of the basic input and output functions most often required by the user or specified by national or international standards. They will assist in the checking or development of the initial specification, and all should be considered before moving to the design stage.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a technique for time-domain electromagnetic inverse scattering based upon the use of a two-dimensional, finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) forward scattering field representation in numerical feedback loop with a nonlinear optimization routine. Causality is exploited to reconstruct the actual target surface contour in a sequential and cumulative manner as the illuminating wavefront sweeps across the target. This approach appears to require a minimum amount of scattered field information. A number of examples are reported where the only data needed is the time waveform of a scattered pulse for the transverse magnetic (TM) polarization case, observed at just a single point in the near field. These examples include the reconstruction of two-dimensional conducting and homogeneous dielectric target shapes such as triangles, rectangles, and trapezoids. A dielectric target with reentrant features, resembling the letter "J" is also reconstructed from a single point observation. The effects of measurement signal-to-noise ratio upon this inverse-scattering technique are determined via numerical experiments. These effects are discussed in two contexts: 1) probability of exact reconstruction vs. signal-to-noise ratio, and 2) sensitivity of reconstructions to noise. It is shown that, even at low signal-to-noise ratios (where the probability of exact reconstruction is also low), the imperfectly-reconstructed targets retain many of the distinguishing features of the original target. This indicates that the reconstruction process is quite robust relative to noise. Developments in nonlinear optimization appear promising for further improving the reliability and quality of target reconstruction in noise.},

The model consists of the tongue, hyoid bone, jaw, larynx complex, bilateral piriform fossae, and vocal tract wall that includes the hard palate, soft palate, pharyngeal wall. In this study, we generated a series of time-varying vocal tract shapes in simulating vowel-vowel (VV) sequence by the 3D articulatory model and analyzed their acoustic characteristics using the finite-difference timedomain (FDTD) method. Area functions (AF) showed that the vocal tract shapes vary smoothly frame by frame, while the transfer functions (TF) transit continuously from vowel to vowel for the first four formants. Acoustic roles of the piriform fossae were also examined. The piriform fossa generated two spectral d ips around 4 kHz in transfer function. Pressure distribution patterns at first four formant frequencies for vowel /a/were examined, which are consistent with previous studies. Experimental results showed that our physiological model can describe the details of the vocal tract.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the perception of dynamic range in the nonlinear system. The work is differentiated from the generic investigation of ‘sound quality' which is usually associated with studies of nonlinear distortion. The proposed hypothesis suggests that distortion products generated within the compressive type nonlinear system are able to act as loudness compensator for the associated amplitude compression in the loudness function. The hypothesis is tested using the Time-Varying Loudness model of Glasberg and Moore (2002) and further tested using AB scale hidden reference type listening test methods. The Loudness Overflow Effect (LOE) is introduced and bandwidth is shown to be a significant limiting factor. Results and immediate implications are briefly discussed.},

@article{Takeuchi2002,
abstract = {When binaural sound signals are presented with loudspeakers, the system inversion involved gives rise to a number of problems such as a loss of dynamic range and a lack of robustness to small errors and room reflections. The amplification required by the system inversion results in loss of dynamic range. The control performance of such a system deteriorates severely due to small errors resulting from, e.g., misalignment of the system and individual differences in the head related transfer functions at certain frequencies. The required large sound radiation results in severe reflection which also reduces the control performance. A method of overcoming these fundamental problems is proposed in this paper. A conceptual monopole transducer is introduced whose position varies continuously as frequency varies. This gives a minimum processing requirement of the binaural signals for the control to be achieved and all the above problems either disappear or are minimized. The inverse filters have flat amplitude response and the reproduced sound is not colored even outside the relatively large "sweet area". A number of practical solutions are suggested for the realization of such optimally distributed transducers. One of them is a discretization that enables the use of conventional transducer units.},

@article{Bauer1971,
abstract = {This paper reviews the available evidence (published and unpublished) on the relation between loudness and stimulus intensity. The evidence suggests that for the typical listener the loudness L of a 1000-cycle tone can be approximated by a power function of intensity I, of which the exponent is log102. The equation is: L = kI0.3. Intensity here is assumed to be proportional to the square of the sound pressure. In terms of sones, where 1 sone is the loudness produced by a tone at 40 db above the standard reference level, the equation for loudness L as a function of the number of decibels N becomes: logL = 0.03N−1.2. Otherwise said, a loudness ratio of 2:1 is produced by a pair of stimuli that differ by 10 db, and this relation appears to hold over the entire range of audible intensities. At low levels of intensity, the loudness of white noise grows more rapidly than the loudness of a 1000-cycle tone, but above the level of approximately 50 db the two loudnesses remain more nearly proportional. The suggestion is made that for all levels greater than 50 db the loudness of continuous noises may be calculated from the equation: logL = 0.03N+S, where S is a spectrum parameter to be determined empirically.},

Then it concentrates on the ray-tracing algorithm, and offers the author's implementation of the method and an evaluation of its accuracy when comparing modeled sound decays and predicted acoustical parameters with the corresponding measured data in three different enclosures. First, a general introduction of the sound propagation principles and a discussion of the state of the art in room acoustics modeling are given. How to implement the ray-tracing algorithm is explained, not only the way adopted by the author but also other possibilities which could improve accuracy. That is followed by a geometrical and an acoustical description of the three studied enclosures, and the comparison of the modeled and measured data. Sound pressure level is predicted with very good accuracy, while reverberation time is more contradictory due to the negation of the wave nature of sound which is inherent in the model. The paper ends with a discussion of the results' accuracy and the reasons for similarities and/or differences.},

One such case is simulation of room acoustics with wave-based modeling techniques. In this paper we show that it is possible to run room acoustic simulations with a finite-difference time-domain model in real-time for a modest-size geometry up to 7kHz sampling rate. For a 10{\{}{\%}{\}} maximum disper- sion error limit this means that our system can be used for real- time auralization up to 1.5kHz. In addition, the system is able to handle several simultaneous sound sources and a moving listener with no additional cost. The results of this study include perfor- mance comparison of different schemes showing that the interpo- lated wideband scheme is able to handle in real-time 1.4 times the bandwidth of the standard rectilinear scheme with the same maxi- mum dispersion error.},

abstract = {The paper describes a new determination of the equal-loudness relations for pure tones in free-field conditions which has been carried out at the National Physical Laboratory as a result of requests from organizations interested in various aspects of the acoustics of hearing. The equal-loudness contours are of considerable importance in this field, being fundamental to a proper understanding of aural judgments of the loudness of sounds of all kinds. They are also concerned in numerous practical applications in the study of noise. The first set of contours for free-field conditions was given by Fletcher and Munson in 1933, and a second determination was carried out by Churcher and King in 1937, but these two investigations showed considerable discrepancies over parts of the auditory diagram. The present work has been carried out on a more extensive scale, using a large team of otologically normal persons, and new techniques have been introduced enabling reliable measurements to be made over a wider range of intensity than has hitherto been possible. The new results cover a range of frequency of from 25 to 15 000 c/s and of sound pressure level up to about 130 dB relative to 0.000 2 dyn/cm2. The data show a greater degree of regularity than the former results, and allow the equivalent loudness of a pure tone of any frequency to be expressed by formulae quadratic in the sound pressure level, the coefficients varying smoothly with frequency. The results include a new determination of the normal threshold of hearing in free field, which is highly consistent with the equal-loudness contours. At frequencies above 1000 c/s account needs to be taken of variations due to the age of the observers, which become of particular importance at the upper end of the frequency range. The new results have indicated the causes of some of the discordant features in the earlier determinations and it is hoped that the work will facilitate agreement on a standard set of equal-loudness contours. On account of its relevance to noise measurement, some extension to equal-loudness relations for bands of noise is being undertaken.},

abstract = {Laplace-domain waveform inversion reconstructs long-wavelength subsurface models by using the zero-frequency component of damped seismic signals. Despite the computational advantages of Laplace-domain waveform inversion over conventional frequency-domain waveform inversion, an acoustic assumption and an iterative matrix solver have been used to invert 3D marine datasets to mitigate the intensive computing cost. In this study, we develop a Laplace-domain waveform modeling and inversion algorithm for 3D acoustic-elastic coupled media by using a parallel sparse direct solver library (MUltifrontal Massively Parallel Solver, MUMPS). We precisely simulate a real marine environment by coupling the 3D acoustic and elastic wave equations with the proper boundary condition at the fluid-solid interface. In addition, we can extract the elastic properties of the Earth below the sea bottom from the recorded acoustic pressure datasets. As a matrix solver, the parallel sparse direct solver is used to factorize the non-symmetric impedance matrix in a distributed memory architecture and rapidly solve the wave field for a number of shots by using the lower and upper matrix factors. Using both synthetic datasets and real datasets obtained by a 3D wide azimuth survey, the long-wavelength component of the P-wave and S-wave velocity models is reconstructed and the proposed modeling and inversion algorithm are verified. A cluster of 80 CPU cores is used for this study.},

These methods, which possess excellent stability and stability verification properties, have appeared in various guises as the transmission line matrix (TLM) method, multidimensional wave digital (MDWD) filtering and digital waveguide (DWN) methods. This text provides a unified framework for all of these techniques and addresses the question of how they are related to more standard numerical simulation techniques. Covering circuit/scattering models in electromagnetics, transmission line modelling, elastic dynamics, as well as time-varying and nonlinear systems, this book highlights the general applicability of this technique across a variety of disciplines, as well as the inter-relationships between simulation techniques and digital filter design. provides a comprehensive overview of scattering-based numerical integration methods. reviews the basics of classical electrical network theory, wave digital filters, and digital waveguide networks. discusses applications for time-varying and nonlinear systems. includes an extensive bibliography containing over 250 references. Mixing theory and application with numerical simulation results, this book will be suitable for both experts and readers with a limited background in signal processing and numerical techniques.},

This paper evaluates the PML in three-dimensional FDTD acoustic simulations. It confirms the existence of an optimum loss factor, with higher values degrading PML performance. An empirical formula is offered for estimating the optimum loss factor for a linear or a quadratic profile, that depends on the PML depth, sound speed, and grid resolution.},

abstract = {Most gunshot injuries to the hand involve a combination of tissue types. The goal of this study is to report the results of early definitive treatment in extra-articular metacarpal and proximal phalangeal fractures due to low velocity gunshot wounds and to analyse their outcomes. A retrospective analysis of 51 metacarpal and 41 proximal phalangeal fractures of 76 patients due to low velocity gunshot wounds treated between January 2001 and December 2004 was carried out. We applied acute fixation in the first 24 hours. The patients were evaluated with total active motion scores, radiographic control, complication rate and the need for revision surgery. The infection frequency was 10.5{\%} and the need for a revision surgery was 7{\%}. The plate fixation group had significantly higher total active motion scores than the external fixation group. The K wire group had the highest revision rate. The bone grafting group was associated with good total active motion scores and low complication rates. The majority of the low velocity gunshot injuries are surgically clean wounds which allow not only early fracture fixation, but also early bone grafting and soft tissue reconstruction. Plate and screw fixation is associated with significantly better functional outcomes than the minimal fixation group.},

In this note, we review the basic ideas of spectral differentiation (for equally spaced samples) and a correct resolution of the aliasing problems for implementing operations dy dx},

As a relatively simple example, chaotic oscillations in low-pressure thermionic discharges are discussed in detail. Period doubling bifurcations and intermittency are clearly identified as standard routes to chaotic behaviour. Most of its dynamical features are well described by simple nonlinear oscillator models. In contrast, plasma waves are spatiotemporal phenomena and thus show a much richer dynamical behaviour. This is demonstrated for current-driven drift waves in a linear magnetized plasma. Probe arrays provide the required information about the time evolution of the azimuthal wave structure.},

abstract = {A single room impulse response can reveal information about the acoustics of a given space in both objective, and, when used for auralization, subjective terms. However, for additional spatial information, or more accurate and perceptually convincing auralization, multiple impulse responses are needed. Higher order Ambisonics is a robust means of capturing the spatial qualities of an acoustic space over multiple channels for decoding and rendering over many possible speaker layouts. A method for obtaining {\{}{\$}{\}}N{\{}{\$}{\}}th-order Ambisonic impulse responses from a room acoustic model, based on lower orders using differential microphone techniques is presented. This is tested using a third-order encoding of a 2-D finite difference time domain room acoustic simulation based on multiple circular arrays of receivers. Accurate channel directional profiles are obtained and results are verified in a series of listening tests comparing the localization of a sound source placed within the given simulation to the same source encoded directly. This generic encoding scheme can be applied to any room acoustic simulation technique where it is possible to obtain impulse responses across multiple receiver positions. Although the proposed method encompasses horizontal encoding only, it can also be applied directly in 3-D simulations where height information is not required in the final auralization.},

abstract = {Noise has many roles in biological function, including generation of errors in DNA replication leading to mutation and evolution, noise-driven divergence of cell fates, noise-induced amplification of signals, and maintenance of the quantitative individuality of cells. Yet there is order to the behaviour and development of cells. They operate within strict parameters and in many cases this behaviour seems robust, implying that noise is largely filtered by the system. How can we explain the use, rejection and sensitivity to noise that is found in biological systems? An exploration of the sources and consequences of noise calls for the use of stochastic models.},

abstract = {Stabilized explicit-implicit domain decomposition is a group of methods for solving time-depen- dent partial difference equations of the parabolic type on parallel computers. They are efficient, stable, and highly parallel, but suffer from a restriction that the interface boundaries must not intersect inside the domain. Various techniques have been proposed to handle this restriction. In this paper, we present finite difference schemes for discretizing the equation spatially, which is of high simplicity, easy to implement, attains second-order spatial accuracy, and allows interface boundaries to intersect inside the domain.},

abstract = {Investigation of wafer spatial variations is critical for semiconductor process/equipment optimization and circuit design. The objective of spatial variation study is to differentiate the systematic variation component from the random component. This is usually done by contrasting with a set of known systematic patterns based on engineering knowledge. However, there could exist unknown systematic components remaining in the unexplained residuals and overlooked by the conventional spatial variation study. In this paper, we develop a novel spatial variance spectrum (SVS) to analyze the systematic variations without any priori information of the systematic patterns. The SVS is a series of spatial variations over a range of spatial moving window sizes from the smallest spatial moving window consisting of only two metrology sites to the largest one covering all metrology sites of the entire wafer. The SVS can be used to characterize the wafer spatial variations and to detect existence of systematic variations by a proposed hypothesis test. We also propose an index to summarize from the SVS the systematic proportion of the spatial variation. The proposed test and index of systematic variations will be demonstrated and validated through both hypothetical examples and actual cases of wafer critical dimension (CD) metrology data.},

The new method is the extension of the classic auralization process based on the linear convolution of the "dry" original signal with the impulse response of the system. The extension allows for the emulation of non-linear systems, characterized in terms of harmonic distortion at several orders. The work first presents the mathematical framework of the proposed implementation, then it is shown how a not linear system can be experimentally characterized by a new measurement method of multiple impulse responses at various harmonic orders, and finally it is shown how these impulse responses can be employed in a multiple convolution process: an experimental demonstration is given of the similarity of the numerically processed sound with the live recording coming from a highly distorting device.},

While interactive geometrical approaches can be used for more accurate acoustical modeling, the increased authoring complexity and the additional cost of geometrical calculations still appears to overshadow their potential benefits. This paper presents solutions to integrate off-line geometrical acoustic modeling in game environments. By pre-computing image-source gradients for early reflections and directional decay profiles, we can generate location dependent reverberation effects without storing or accessing the actual geometry at run-time. We render such reverberation effects using a frequency-domain scalable processing approach. In this context, we introduce an efficient prioritization scheme and evaluate alternative transforms for late reverberation processing. Our pipeline enables fine-grain rendering of distance and surface proximity effects and modeling of both outdoor and coupled indoor spaces with arbitrary reverberation decay profiles},

abstract = {We design a numerical algorithm for wave simulation in anelastic media in the presence of free surface, which can be used to model seismic waves at the Earth's surface and ultrasonic waves in heterogeneous materials. The stress-strain relation is based on the Kelvin-Voigt mechanical model, which has the advantage of not requiring additional field variables. The model requires two anelastic parameters and twice the spatial derivatives of the lossless case. The high-frequency components of the wave field are more attenuated than the low-frequency components, with the attenuation factors being approximately proportional to the square of the frequency. The modeling simulates 3-D waves by using the Fourier and Chebyshev methods to compute the spatial derivatives along the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. We stretch the mesh in the vertical direction to increase the minimum grid spacing and reduce the computational cost. Instabilities of the Chebyshev differential operator due to the implementation of the free-surface boundary conditions are solved with a characteristic approach, where the characteristic variables are evaluated at the source central frequency. The results of the modeling are verified by comparisons to the analytical solutions for Lamb's problem and propagation in unbounded homogeneous media. Examples illustrating the propagation of Rayleigh and Love waves are presented. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Wishnick2014,
abstract = {A variety of methods are available for implementing time-varying digital filters for musical applications. The considerations for mu- sical applications differ from those of other applications, such as speech coding. This domain requires realtime parametric control of a filter such as an equalizer, allowing parameters to vary each sample, e.g. by user interaction, a low-frequency oscillator (LFO), or an envelope. It is desirable to find a filter structure that is time- varying stable, artifact-free, computationally efficient, easily sup- ports arbitrary filter shapes, and yields sensible intermediate filter shapes when interpolating coefficients. It is proposed to use the state variable filter (SVF) for this purpose. A novel proof of its stable time-varying behavior is presented. Equations are derived for matching common equalizer filter shapes, as well as any z- domain transfer function, making the SVF suitable for efficiently implementing any recursive filter. The SVF is compared to state of the art filter structures in an objective evaluation and a subjective listening test. The results confirm that the SVF has good audio quality, while supporting the aforementioned advantageous quali- ties in a time-varying digital filter for music. They also show that a class of time-varying filter techniques useful for speech coding are unsuitable for musical applications.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic genomic information is modulated by a variety ofepigenetic modifications that play both a direct role in establishing transcription profiles, modulation of DNA replication and repair processes and also indirect effects on the aforementioned processes through the organization of DNA architecture within the cell nucleus. Nowadays, the role of epigenetic modifications in regulating tissue-specific expression, genomic imprinting or X-chromosome inactivation is widely recognized. In addition, the key role of epigenetic modifications during cell differentiation and development has been highlighted by the identification of a variety of epigenetic alterations in human disease. Particular attention has been focused on the study of epigenetic alterations in cancer, which is the subject of intense multidisciplinary efforts and has an impact not only in understanding the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation but also in guiding the development ofnovel therapies for cancer treatment. In addition, a number of genetic disorders such as immunodeficiency-centromere instability-facial anomalies (ICF) or Rett syndromes are directly associated with defects in elements of the epigenetic machinery. More recently, epigenetic changes in cardiovascular, neurological and autoimmune disorders as well as in other genetically complex diseases have also started to emerge. All these examples illustrate the widespread association ofepigenetic alterations with disease and highlight the need of characterizing the range and extension of epigenetic changes to understand their contribution to fundamental human biological processes.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been growing interest in modeling sound propagation in complex, three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments. With diverse applications for the military, the gaming industry, psychoacoustics researchers, architectural acousticians, and others, advances in computing power and 3D audio-rendering techniques have driven research and development aimed at closing the gap between the auralization and visualization of virtual spaces. To this end, this thesis focuses on improving the physical and perceptual realism of sound-field simulations in virtual environments through advances in edge-diffraction modeling. To model sound propagation in virtual environments, acoustical simulation tools commonly rely on geometrical-acoustics (GA) techniques that assume asymptotically high frequencies, large flat surfaces, and infinitely thin ray-like propagation paths. Such techniques can be augmented with diffraction modeling to compensate for the effect of surface size on the strength and directivity of a reflection, to allow for propagation around obstacles and into shadow zones, and to maintain sound-field continuity across reflection and shadow boundaries. Using a time-domain, line-integral formulation of the Biot-Tolstoy-Medwin (BTM) diffraction expression, this thesis explores various aspects of diffraction calculations for virtual-acoustic simulations. Specifically, we first analyze the periodic singularity of the BTM integrand and describe the relationship between the singularities and higher-order reflections within wedges with open angle less than 180 degrees. Coupled with analytical approximations for the BTM expression, this analysis allows for accurate numerical computations and a continuous sound field in the vicinity of an arbitrary wedge geometry insonified by a point source. Second, we describe an edge-subdivision strategy that allows for fast diffraction calculations with low error relative to a numerically more accurate solution. Third, to address the considerable increase in propagation paths due to diffraction, we describe a simple procedure for identifying and culling insignificant diffraction components during a virtual-acoustic simulation. Finally, we present a novel method to find GA components using diffraction parameters that ensures continuity at reflection and shadow boundaries.},

The primary design variable for optimisation was the complex transfer functions applied to each acoustic source. We then describe how the optimised transfer functions were implemented with FIR filters on typically available hardware. Finally, comparison was made between the predicted and measured output for a large array.},

abstract = {There is a widespread belief that the increasing use of dynamic range compression in music mastering (the loudnesswar) deteriorates sound quality but experimental evidence of perceptual effects is lacking. In this study, normal hearing listeners were asked to evaluate popular music recordings in original versions and in remastered versions with higher levels of dynamic range compression. Surprisingly, we found no evidence of preference for the less compressed music. We also failed to find differences in ratings of perceived "depth" between the original and more compressed audio. A low degree of response consistency between different presentations of the same music suggests that listeners are less sensitive to even high levels of dynamic range compression than often argued. 0},

abstract = {A well established method for estimating the shape of the auditory filter is based on the measurement of the threshold of a sinusoidal signal in a notched-noise masker, as a function of notch width. To measure the asymmetry of the filter, the notch has to be placed both symmetrically and asymmetrically about the signal frequency. In previous work several simplifying assumptions and approximations were made in deriving auditory filter shapes from the data. In this paper we describe modifications to the fitting procedure which allow more accurate derivations. These include: 1) taking into account changes in filter bandwidth with centre frequency when allowing for the effects of off-frequency listening; 2) correcting for the non-flat frequency response of the earphone; 3) correcting for the transmission characteristics of the outer and middle ear; 4) limiting the amount by which the centre frequency of the filter can shift in order to maximise the signal-to-masker ratio. In many cases, these modifications result in only small changes to the derived filter shape. However, at very high and very low centre frequencies and for hearing-impaired subjects the differences can be substantial. It is also shown that filter shapes derived from data where the notch is always placed symmetrically about the signal frequency can be seriously in error when the underlying filter is markedly asymmetric. New formulae are suggested describing the variation of the auditory filter with frequency and level. The implications of the results for the calculation of excitation patterns are discussed and a modified procedure is proposed. The appendix lists FORTRAN computer programs for deriving auditory filter shapes from notched-noise data and for calculating excitation patterns. The first program can readily be modified so as to derive auditory filter shapes from data obtained with other types of maskers, such as rippled noise. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 1990.},

Also, the image model can provide insight into the fundamental acoustical properties of different concert hall geometries. For example, the extended image model demonstrates that rectangular halls have an advantage over fan-shaped halls with regard to spatial impression.

abstract = {10.1. INTRODUCTION As with any occupational hazard, control technology should aim at reducing noise to acceptable levels by action on the work environment. Such action involves the implementation of any measure that will reduce noise being generated, and/or will reduce the noise transmission through the air or through the structure of the workplace. Such measures include modifications of the machinery, the workplace operations, and the layout of the workroom. In fact, the best approach for noise hazard control in the work environment, is to eliminate or reduce the hazard at its source of generation, either by direct action on the source or by its confinement. Practical considerations must not be overlooked; it is often unfeasible to implement a global control program all at once. The most urgent problems have to be solved first; priorities have to be set up. In certain cases, the solution may be found in a combination of measures which by themselves would not be enough; for example, to achieve part of the required reduction through environmental measures and to complement them with personal measures (e.g. wearing hearing protection for only 2-3 hours), bearing in mind that it is extremely difficult to make sure that hearing protection is properly fitted and properly worn. This chapter presents the principles of engineering control of noise, specific control measures and some examples. Reading of chapter 1 is indispensable for the understanding of this chapter. Note that many of the specific noise control measures described are intended as a rough guide only. Further information on the subject can be found in ISO 11690 and in the specialised literature. Also suppliers of equipment and noise control hardware can often provide helpful noise control advice. 10.2. NOISE CONTROL STRATEGIES (See ISO 11690) Prior to the selection and design of control measures, noise sources must be identified and the noise produced must be carefully evaluated. Procedures for taking noise measurements in the course of a noise survey are discussed in chapter 7.},

abstract = {Previously we described a model for calculating the loudness of steady sou nds from their spectrum. Here a new version of the model is presented, which uses a waveform as its input. The stages of the model are as follows. (a) A finite impulse response filter representing transfer through the outer and middle ear. (b) Calculation of the short-term spectrum using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). To give adequate spectral resolution at low frequencies, combined with adequate temporal resolution at high frequencies, six FFTs are calculated in parallel, using longer signal segments for low frequencies and shorter segments for higher frequencies. (c) Calculation of an excitation pauern from the physical spectrum. (d) Transformation of the excitation pattern to a specific loudness pattern. (e) Determination of the area under the specific loudness pattern. This gives a value for the "instantaneous" loudness. The short-term perceived loudness is calculated from the instantaneous loudness using an averaging mechanism similar to an automatic gain control system, with attack and release times. Finally the overall loudness impression is calculated from the short-term loudness using a similar averaging mechanism, but with longer attack and release times. The new model gives very similar predictions to our earlier model for steady sounds. In addition, it can predict the loudness of brief sounds as a function of duration and the overall loudness of sounds that are amplitude modulated at various rates.},

abstract = {Geometrical acoustics are used as a standard model for room acoustic design and consulting. Research on room acoustic simulation focuses on a more accurate modeling of propagation effects such as diffraction and other wave effects in rooms, and on scattering. Much progress was made in this field so that wave models also (for example, the boundary element method and the finite differences in time domain) can now be used for higher frequencies. The concepts and implementations of room simulation methods are briefly reviewed. After all, simulations in architectural acoustics are indeed powerful tools, but their reliability depends on the skills of the operator who has to create an adequate polygon model and has to choose the correct input data of boundary conditions such as absorption and scattering. Very little is known about the uncertainty of this input data. With the theory of error propagation of uncertainties it can be shown that prediction of reverberation times with accuracy better than the just noticeable difference requires input data in a quality which is not available from reverberation room measurements.},

This book presents the key ideas along with many figures, examples, and short, elegant MATLAB programs for readers to adapt to their own needs. It covers ODE and PDE boundary value problems, eigenvalues and pseudospectra, linear and nonlinear waves, and numerical quadrature.},

They make it possible to run certain tasks orders of magnitude faster than what is possible with a cen- tral processing unit (CPU). One such case is simulation of room acoustics with wave-based modeling techniques. In this paper we show that it is possible to run room acoustic simulations with a finite-difference time-domain model in real-time for a modest-size geometry up to 7kHz sampling rate. For a 10{\%} maximum disper- sion error limit this means that our system can be used for real- time auralization up to 1.5kHz. In addition, the system is able to handle several simultaneous sound sources and a moving listener with no additional cost. The results of this study include perfor- mance comparison of different schemes showing that the interpo- lated wideband scheme is able to handle in real-time 1.4 times the bandwidth of the standard rectilinear scheme with the same maxi- mum dispersion error.},

abstract = {Due to recent increases in computing power, room acoustics simulation in 3D using time stepping schemes is becoming a viable alternative to standard methods based on ray tracing and the image source method. Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) methods, operating over regular grids, are perhaps the best known among such methods, which simulate the acoustic field in its entirety over the problem domain. In a realistic room acoustics setting, working over a regular grid is attractive from a computational standpoint, but is complicated by geometrical considerations, particularly when the geometry does not conform neatly to the grid, and those of boundary conditions which emulate the properties of real wall materials. Both such features may be dealt with through an appeal to methods operating over unstructured grids, such as finite volume methods, which reduce to FDTD when employed over regular grids. Through numerical energy analysis, such methods lead to direct stability conditions for complex problems, including convenient geometrical conditions at irregular boundaries. Simulation results are presented.},

abstract = {The goals of this study were to characterize and model the perception of nonlinearly distorted speech and music by hearing-impaired listeners. Hearing-impaired listeners were asked to rate the perceived quality of speech and music that had been subjected to various forms of nonlinear distortion, some of which are inherent to certain hearing aid designs including (1) hard and soft, symmetrical and asymmetrical clipping; (2) center clipping; (3) "full-range" distortion, produced by raising the absolute magnitude of the instantaneous amplitude of the signal to a power (8800;1), while preserving the signal of the amplitude; (4) automatic gain control (AGC); (5) output limiting. Stimuli were subjected to frequency-dependent amplification as prescribed by the "Cambridge formula" before presentation via Sennheiser HD580 earphones. The pattern of the rating was reasonably consistent across subjects with only two of ten subjects not making consistent ratings. The mean ratings were not lower with increasing amount of soft or center clipping or when the compression ratios of the AGC and output limiting were increased. The deleterious effects produced by these nonlinear distortions may have been offset by the beneficial effects of improving audibility and compensating for loudness recruitment.

As a direct time-domain simulation, suitable for large modeling regions, the technique seems a good brute force approach for solving room acoustic problems. Some attention is paid in this paper to a few of the key problems involved in applying FDTD: frequency-dependent boundary conditions, non-Cartesian grids, and numerical error. Possible applications are illustrated with an example. An interesting approach lies in using the FDTD simulation to adapt a digital filter to represent the acoustical transfer function from source to observer, as accurately as possible. The approximate digital filter can be used for auralization experiments.},

abstract = {This document describes the implementation of the DocStrip program. The original version of this program was developed by Frank Mittelbach to accompany his doc.sty which enables literate programming in LATEX. Denys Duchier rewrote it to run either with TEX or with LATEX, and to allow full boolean expressions in conditional guards instead of just comma-separated lists. Johannes Braams re-united the two implementations, documented and debugged the code. In September 1995 Marcin Woli{\'{n}}ski changed many parts of the program to make use of TEX's ability to write to multiple files at the same time to avoid re-reading sources. The performance improvement of version 2.3 came at a price of compatibility with some more obscure operating systems which limit the number of files a process can keep open. This was corrected in September 1996 by Mark Wooding and his changes were “creatively merged” by Marcin Woli{\'{n}}ski who made at the same time changes in batch files processing, handling of preambles and introduced “verbatim mode”. After all that, David Carlisle merged the new version into the LATEX sources, and made a few other changes, principally making DocStrip work under initex, and removing the need for batch files to say $\backslash$def$\backslash$batchfile{\{}...{\}}.},

abstract = {Acoustic signals pass through numerous transforms in the auditory system before perceptual attributes such as loudness and pitch are derived. However, relatively little is known as to exactly when these transformations happen, and where, cortically or sub-cortically, they occur. In an effort to examine this, we investigated the latencies and locations of cortical entrainment to two transforms predicted by a model of loudness perception for time-varying sounds: the transforms were instantaneous loudness and short-term loudness, where the latter is hypothesized to be derived from the former and therefore should occur later in time. Entrainment of cortical activity was estimated from electro- and magneto-encephalographic (EMEG) activity, recorded while healthy subjects listened to continuous speech. There was entrainment to instantaneous loudness bilaterally at 45, 100, and 165 ms, in Heschl's gyrus, dorsal lateral sulcus, and Heschl's gyrus, respectively. Entrainment to short-term loudness was found in both the dorsal lateral sulcus and superior temporal sulcus at 275 ms. These results suggest that short-term loudness is derived from instantaneous loudness, and that this derivation occurs after processing in sub-cortical structures.},

Since in practice many loudspeaker line arrays are not actually straight, expressions are provided for curved (arc), J, and progressive line arrays. In addition, since loudspeaker systems are often not perfect sources, the effects of spherical radiating sources and gaps between sources are analyzed.

The latter fails to accurately capture the plasmonic resonant modes excited in the lattices under consideration. The studies presented in this paper are particularly aimed at rigorously investigating the possibility of backward-wave propagation in periodic arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles, along with their potential analogy to microwave negative-refractive index transmission-line metamaterials.},

These methods, in contrast to more common finite-difference, time-domain approaches, provide isotropic dispersion characteristics.

In the current paper we present a novel semi-empirical formulation for simulating constant impedance boundary conditions within Pseudo-Spectral techniques based on the Fourier transform.

The test involves: (1) an appropriate experimental design; (2) an inoculation procedure; (3) a test procedure; and (4) interpretation of results; The results are evaluated in relation to set safety criteria and, if satisfactory, should be confirmed under field conditions (verification).

abstract = {A perfectly matched layer (PML) is commonly used in finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation to absorb outgoing waves and thereby reduce artifactual reflections from the computational domain boundaries. However, previous two-dimensional studies have noted that increasing the PML loss factor does not monotonically improve the PML's performance. This paper evaluates the PML in three-dimensional FDTD acoustic simulations. It confirms the existence of an optimum loss factor, with higher values degrading PML performance. An empirical formula is offered for estimating the optimum loss factor for a linear or a quadratic profile, that depends on the PML depth, sound speed, and grid resolution.},

abstract = {Finite-difference time-domain(FDTD) simulation has been a popular area of research in room acoustics due to its capability to simulate wave phenomena in a wide bandwidth directly in the time-domain. A downside of the method is that it introduces a direction and frequency dependent error to the simulated sound field due to the non-linear dispersion relation of the discrete system. In this study, the perceptual threshold of the dispersion error is measured in three-dimensional FDTD schemes as a function of simulation distance. Dispersion error is evaluated for three different explicit, non-staggered FDTD schemes using the numerical wavenumber in the direction of the worst-case error of each scheme. It is found that the thresholds for the different schemes do not vary significantly when the phase velocity error level is fixed. The thresholds are found to vary significantly between the different sound samples. The measured threshold for the audibility of dispersion error at the probability level of 82{\%} correct discrimination for three-alternative forced choice is found to be 9.1 m of propagation in a free field, that leads to a maximum group delay error of 1.8 ms at 20 kHz with the chosen phase velocity error level of 2{\%}.},

In one half of cases the preoperative joint flexion deformity was reduced from 78° to 34°. The best results were observed in patients with osteoarthritis and stiff, immobilized joints. In patients with inflammatory arthritides, marked intraoperative correction was maintained rarely, joint contractures recurred early, and patients were unsatisfied. There were no intraoperative complications. Percutaneous release of the accessory collateral ligaments can produce a long lasting correction of the joint contracture, but careful patient selection and strict postoperative rehabilitation are essential for favorable outcome.},

abstract = {The paper describes a new determination of the equal-loudness relations for pure tones in free-field conditions which has been carried out at the National Physical Laboratory as a result of requests from organizations interested in various aspects of the acoustics of hearing. The equal-loudness contours are of considerable importance in this field, being fundamental to a proper understanding of aural judgments of the loudness of sounds of all kinds. They are also concerned in numerous practical applications in the study of noise. The first set of contours for free-field conditions was given by Fletcher and Munson in 1933, and a second determination was carried out by Churcher and King in 1937, but these two investigations showed considerable discrepancies over parts of the auditory diagram. The present work has been carried out on a more extensive scale, using a large team of otologically normal persons, and new techniques have been introduced enabling reliable measurements to be made over a wider range of intensity than has hitherto been possible. The new results cover a range of frequency of from 25 to 15 000 c/s and of sound pressure level up to about 130 dB relative to 0.000 2 dyn/cm2. The data show a greater degree of regularity than the former results, and allow the equivalent loudness of a pure tone of any frequency to be expressed by formulae quadratic in the sound pressure level, the coefficients varying smoothly with frequency. The results include a new determination of the normal threshold of hearing in free field, which is highly consistent with the equal-loudness contours. At frequencies above 1000 c/s account needs to be taken of variations due to the age of the observers, which become of particular importance at the upper end of the frequency range. The new results have indicated the causes of some of the discordant features in the earlier determinations and it is hoped that the work will facilitate agreement on a standard set of equal-loudness contours. On account of its relevance to noise measurement, some extension to equal-loudness relations for bands of noise is being undertaken.},

abstract = {10.1. INTRODUCTION As with any occupational hazard, control technology should aim at reducing noise to acceptable levels by action on the work environment. Such action involves the implementation of any measure that will reduce noise being generated, and/or will reduce the noise transmission through the air or through the structure of the workplace. Such measures include modifications of the machinery, the workplace operations, and the layout of the workroom. In fact, the best approach for noise hazard control in the work environment, is to eliminate or reduce the hazard at its source of generation, either by direct action on the source or by its confinement. Practical considerations must not be overlooked; it is often unfeasible to implement a global control program all at once. The most urgent problems have to be solved first; priorities have to be set up. In certain cases, the solution may be found in a combination of measures which by themselves would not be enough; for example, to achieve part of the required reduction through environmental measures and to complement them with personal measures (e.g. wearing hearing protection for only 2-3 hours), bearing in mind that it is extremely difficult to make sure that hearing protection is properly fitted and properly worn. This chapter presents the principles of engineering control of noise, specific control measures and some examples. Reading of chapter 1 is indispensable for the understanding of this chapter. Note that many of the specific noise control measures described are intended as a rough guide only. Further information on the subject can be found in ISO 11690 and in the specialised literature. Also suppliers of equipment and noise control hardware can often provide helpful noise control advice. 10.2. NOISE CONTROL STRATEGIES (See ISO 11690) Prior to the selection and design of control measures, noise sources must be identified and the noise produced must be carefully evaluated. Procedures for taking noise measurements in the course of a noise survey are discussed in chapter 7.},

abstract = {A well established method for estimating the shape of the auditory filter is based on the measurement of the threshold of a sinusoidal signal in a notched-noise masker, as a function of notch width. To measure the asymmetry of the filter, the notch has to be placed both symmetrically and asymmetrically about the signal frequency. In previous work several simplifying assumptions and approximations were made in deriving auditory filter shapes from the data. In this paper we describe modifications to the fitting procedure which allow more accurate derivations. These include: 1) taking into account changes in filter bandwidth with centre frequency when allowing for the effects of off-frequency listening; 2) correcting for the non-flat frequency response of the earphone; 3) correcting for the transmission characteristics of the outer and middle ear; 4) limiting the amount by which the centre frequency of the filter can shift in order to maximise the signal-to-masker ratio. In many cases, these modifications result in only small changes to the derived filter shape. However, at very high and very low centre frequencies and for hearing-impaired subjects the differences can be substantial. It is also shown that filter shapes derived from data where the notch is always placed symmetrically about the signal frequency can be seriously in error when the underlying filter is markedly asymmetric. New formulae are suggested describing the variation of the auditory filter with frequency and level. The implications of the results for the calculation of excitation patterns are discussed and a modified procedure is proposed. The appendix lists FORTRAN computer programs for deriving auditory filter shapes from notched-noise data and for calculating excitation patterns. The first program can readily be modified so as to derive auditory filter shapes from data obtained with other types of maskers, such as rippled noise. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic genomic information is modulated by a variety ofepigenetic modifications that play both a direct role in establishing transcription profiles, modulation of DNA replication and repair processes and also indirect effects on the aforementioned processes through the organization of DNA architecture within the cell nucleus. Nowadays, the role of epigenetic modifications in regulating tissue-specific expression, genomic imprinting or X-chromosome inactivation is widely recognized. In addition, the key role of epigenetic modifications during cell differentiation and development has been highlighted by the identification of a variety of epigenetic alterations in human disease. Particular attention has been focused on the study of epigenetic alterations in cancer, which is the subject of intense multidisciplinary efforts and has an impact not only in understanding the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation but also in guiding the development ofnovel therapies for cancer treatment. In addition, a number of genetic disorders such as immunodeficiency-centromere instability-facial anomalies (ICF) or Rett syndromes are directly associated with defects in elements of the epigenetic machinery. More recently, epigenetic changes in cardiovascular, neurological and autoimmune disorders as well as in other genetically complex diseases have also started to emerge. All these examples illustrate the widespread association ofepigenetic alterations with disease and highlight the need of characterizing the range and extension of epigenetic changes to understand their contribution to fundamental human biological processes.},

abstract = {An extended Fourier pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method is presented to model atmospheric sound propagation by solving the linearized Euler equations. In this method, evaluation of spatial derivatives is based on an eigenfunction expansion. Evaluation on a spatial grid requires only two spatial points per wavelength. Time iteration is done using a low-storage optimized six-stage Runge-Kutta method. This method is applied to two-dimensional non-moving media models, one with screens and one for an urban canyon, with generally high accuracy in both amplitude and phase. For a moving atmosphere, accurate results have been obtained in models with both a uniform and a logarithmic wind velocity profile over a rigid ground surface and in the presence of a screen. The method has also been validated for three-dimensional sound propagation over a screen. For that application, the developed method is in the order of 100 times faster than the second-order-accurate FDTD solution to the linearized Euler equations. The method is found to be well suited for atmospheric sound propagation simulations where effects of complex meteorology and straight rigid boundary surfaces are to be investigated.},

Therefore, the accurate simulation of the acoustic characteristics of a boundary is an important part of any room acoustics prediction model, and in particular diffuse reflections at a boundary is one of the most important properties to model correctly for an accurate and perceptually natural result. This paper presents a comparison of two simulation models for the phenomenon of diffuse reflection at a boundary: one based on introducing physical variations at the boundary itself, and another based on the use of a diffusion equation model.},

abstract = {1 The guide aims to help those who organise music events so that the events run safely. The event organiser, whether an individual, collective or local authority, has prime responsibility for protecting the health, safety and welfare of everyone working at, or attending, the event. 2 The guide brings together information needed by event organisers, their contractors and employees to help them satisfy the requirements of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (HSW Act) and associated regulations. It will also enable organisers to understand the needs of others concerned with events, such as the local authority and emergency services, with whom they will need to co-operate. 3 The guide makes clear what is required and why it is necessary or sensible to do this. The guide does not replace the need for event organisers to seek advice from other sources and particularly for consultation with local authorities and emergency services. 4 As well as event organisers, others will find the guide useful, eg local authorities, health and safety enforcement officers, emergency services, contractors and subcontractors working at the event. The guide provides basic standards and safety measures through which it is hoped to encourage a consistency of approach while leaving scope for flexibility, taking into account the nature and size of the event. In 1993, HSE, in conjunction with the Home Office and the Scottish Office, published The guide to health, safety and welfare at pop concerts and other similar events. The publication was well received and was adopted as the standard for planning and managing health and safety at these events. In the light of changes to health and safety law, and the continuing development of best practice by the event industry, the guide has been reviewed and revised. The advice in this publication has been tried and tested and lays down a firm foundation on which to organise health and safety at music events. Many of the chapters can be applied to other types of event which, although not necessarily having a musical theme, share some of the common characteristics of music events. This publication will enable event organisers, local authorities, the emergency services and HSE to work together to improve event safety. Their commitment to the production of this guide will ensure that health and safety remains a priority and that all involved will be able to continue to enjoy these events in safety. This guide has been written in consultation with an event industry working group and with the co-operation of a great many people. All contributors, including the members of the working group, are listed at the back of the publication in the Acknowledgements section. I am grateful to them for the time, knowledge and expertise which was given freely and without which, this guide would not be possible. I would like to give particular thanks to Lorraine Miller-Patel, Senior Environmental Health Officer, London Borough of Haringey, who had the unenviable task of co-ordinating the work of this project.

A retrospective analysis of 51 metacarpal and 41 proximal phalangeal fractures of 76 patients due to low velocity gunshot wounds treated between January 2001 and December 2004 was carried out. We applied acute fixation in the first 24 hours. The patients were evaluated with total active motion scores, radiographic control, complication rate and the need for revision surgery. The infection frequency was 10.5{\{}{\%}{\}} and the need for a revision surgery was 7{\{}{\%}{\}}. The plate fixation group had significantly higher total active motion scores than the external fixation group. The K wire group had the highest revision rate. The bone grafting group was associated with good total active motion scores and low complication rates. The majority of the low velocity gunshot injuries are surgically clean wounds which allow not only early fracture fixation, but also early bone grafting and soft tissue reconstruction. Plate and screw fixation is associated with significantly better functional outcomes than the minimal fixation group.},

Looking a little closer at it's derivation we can show that it is in fact a toolbox of interrelated techniques that the games community can use to good effect. The results are compelling and the code to compute them is actually straightforward to write, but the paper that introduces it assumes a lot of background knowledge from the first time reader. This paper is an attempt to provide this background, add some insights into the “why” questions, and hopefully give you all you need to add SH lighting to your game.},

The five NLDs are half-wave rectifier, full-wave rectifier, square wave, polynomial function and exponential function. The derivation of harmonic analysis equations are based on Fourier Theorems, Chebyshev Polynomials, and Taylor Series expansions. Besides the harmonics, intermodulation components are also resulted from NLDs.

abstract = {This paper describes a software package for auralisation in inter- active virtual reality environments. Its purpose is to reproduce, in real time, the 3D soundﬁeld within a virtual room where lis- tener and sound sources can be moved freely. Output sound is pre- sented binaurally using headphones. Auralisation is based on geo- metric acoustic models combined with head-related transfer func- tions (HRTFs): the direct sound and reﬂections from each source are computed dynamically by the image-source method. Direc- tional cues are obtained by ﬁltering these incoming sounds by the HRTFs corresponding to their propagation directions relative to the listener, computed on the basis of the information provided by a head-tracking device. Two interactive real-time applications were developed to demonstrate the operation of this software pack- age. Both provide a visual representation of listener (position and head orientation) and sources (including image sources). One fo- cusses on the auralisation-visualisation synchrony and the other on the dynamic calculation of reﬂection paths. Computational perfor- mance results of the auralisation system are presented.},

Low frequencies are modelled using the finite difference time domain method (FDTD), high frequencies are treated with geometric methods. A practical implementation for forming a hybrid RIR is discussed and further demonstrated in the context of a 2nd order B-Format spatial encode of the modelled sound field. The paper discusses the considerations and limitations of forming such hybrid RIRs using wave-based and geometric-based methods.},

Conventional methods for the assessment of room acoustics model the sound propagation in analogy to the propagation of light. More advanced computational methods rely on the numerical solution of the wave equation. A recently presented method is based on multidimensional wave digital principles. It allows a physically exact numerical modelling of the relevant acoustical effects and yields robust algorithms. This contribution presents a new foundation of the multidimensional wave digital principle as applied to room acoustics. It starts from the first principles of physics. From there, the derivation of the algorithm only involves basic knowledge of numerical mathematics, linear algebra, and multidimensional system theory. An example for the simulation of dynamic three-dimensional sound propagation demonstrates the capability of the method ER -},

This can take every detail of the acoustic space into account, including the speaker or headphone-to-ear transfer function. The model can be implemented in real time, with no extraneous latency, using Lake's Huron convolution tech- niques.

abstract = {An open source implementation of the Fourier pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method for computing the propagation of sound is presented, which is geared towards applications in the built environment. Being a wave-based method, PSTD captures phenomena like diffraction, but maintains efficiency in processing time and memory usage as it allows to spatially sample close to the Nyquist criterion, thus keeping both the required spatial and temporal resolution coarse. In the implementation it has been opted to model the physical geometry as a composition of rectangular two-dimensional subdomains, hence initially restricting the implementation to orthogonal and two-dimensional situations. The strategy of using subdomains divides the problem domain into local subsets, which enables the simulation software to be built according to Object-Oriented Programming best practices and allows room for further computational parallelization. The software is built using the open source components, Blender, Numpy and Python, and has been published under an open source license itself as well. For accelerating the software, an option has been included to accelerate the calculations by a partial implementation of the code on the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU), which increases the throughput by up to fifteen times. The details of the implementation are reported, as well as the accuracy of the code.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Since in practice many loudspeaker line arrays are not actually straight, expressions are provided for curved (arc), J, and progressive line arrays. In addition, since loudspeaker systems are often not perfect sources, the effects of spherical radiating sources and gaps between sources are analyzed. Several examples of how to apply the models are given, and modeled performance is compared to measured polar data.},

These findings are discussed extensively within affective disorders literature but their relationship to functional aspects of depressive psychopathology remains unclear. Investigating alpha modulation during active cognitive processing may provide a more targeted means of relating aberrant alpha activity to specific aspects of depression symptomatology. Alpha activity is reliably modulated during working memory (WM) processing and WM impairments are a common neuropsychological consequence of MDD. Moreover, it has been suggested that alpha activity reflects internally mediated inhibitory process and attenuated inhibition has been suggested to contribute to WM inefficacy.},

abstract = {Reduction of noise is one of the multiple benefits of building envelope greening measures. The potential of wall vegetation systems, green roofs, vegetated low screens at roof edges, and also combinations of such treatments, have been studied by means of combining 2D and 3D full-wave numerical methodologies. This study is concerned with road traffic noise propagation towards the traffic-free sides of inner-city buildings (courtyards). Preserving quietness at such locations has been shown before to be beneficial for the health and well-being of citizens. The results in this study show that green roofs have the highest potential to enhance quietness in courtyards. Favourable combinations of roof shape and green roofs have been identified. Vegetated fa{\{}{\c{c}}{\}}ades are most efficient when applied to narrow city canyons with otherwise acoustically hard fa{\{}{\c{c}}{\}}ade materials. Greening of the upper storey's in the street and (full) fa{\{}{\c{c}}{\}}ades in the courtyard itself is most efficient to achieve noise reduction. Low-height roof screens were shown to be effective when multiple screens are placed, but only on conditions that their faces are absorbing. The combination of different greening measures results in a lower combined effect than when the separate effects would have been linearly added. The combination of green roofs or wall vegetation with roof screens seems most interesting. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {When binaural sound signals are presented with loudspeakers, the system inversion involved gives rise to a number of problems such as a loss of dynamic range and a lack of robustness to small errors and room reflections. The amplification required by the system inversion results in loss of dynamic range. The control performance of such a system deteriorates severely due to small errors resulting from, e.g., misalignment of the system and individual differences in the head related transfer functions at certain frequencies. The required large sound radiation results in severe reflection which also reduces the control performance. A method of overcoming these fundamental problems is proposed in this paper. A conceptual monopole transducer is introduced whose position varies continuously as frequency varies. This gives a minimum processing requirement of the binaural signals for the control to be achieved and all the above problems either disappear or are minimized. The inverse filters have flat amplitude response and the reproduced sound is not colored even outside the relatively large "sweet area". A number of practical solutions are suggested for the realization of such optimally distributed transducers. One of them is a discretization that enables the use of conventional transducer units.},

abstract = {The explosion of interest in metamaterials is due to the dramatically increased manipulation ability over light as well as sound waves. This material research was stimulated by the opportunity to develop an artificial media with negative refractive index and the application in superlens which allows super-resolution imaging. High-resolution acoustic imaging techniques are the essential tools for nondestructive testing and medical screening. However, the spatial resolution of the conventional acoustic imaging methods is restricted by the incident wavelength of ultrasound. This is due to the quickly fading evanescent fields which carry the subwavelength features of objects. By focusing the propagating wave and recovering the evanescent field, a flat lens with negative-index can potentially overcome the diffraction limit. We present the first experimental demonstration of focusing ultrasound waves through a flat acoustic metamaterial lens composed of a planar network of subwavelength Helmholtz resonators. We observed a tight focus of half-wavelength in width at 60.5 KHz by imaging a point source. This result is in excellent agreement with the numerical simulation by transmission line model in which we derived the effective mass density and compressibility. This metamaterial lens also displays variable focal length at different frequencies. Our experiment shows the promise of designing compact and light-weight ultrasound imaging elements. ii Moreover, the concept of metamaterial extends far beyond negative refraction, rather giving enormous choice of material parameters for different applications. One of the most interesting examples these years is the invisible cloak. Such a device is proposed to render the hidden object undetectable under the flow of light or sound, by guiding and controlling the wave path through an engineered space surrounding the object. However, the cloak designed by transformation optics usually calls for a highly anisotropic metamaterial, which make the experimental studies remain challenging. We present here the first practical realization of a low-loss and broadband acoustic cloak for underwater ultrasound. This metamaterial cloak is constructed with a network of acoustic circuit elements, namely serial inductors and shunt capacitors. Our experiment clearly shows that the acoustic cloak can effectively bend the ultrasound waves around the hidden object, with reduced scattering and shadow. Due to the non-resonant nature of the building elements, this low loss ({\{}{\~{}}{\}}6dB/m) cylindrical cloak exhibits excellent invisibility over a broad frequency range from 52 to 64 kHz in the measurements. The low visibility of the cloaked object for underwater ultrasound shed a light on the fundamental understanding of manipulation, storage and control of acoustic waves. Furthermore, our experimental study indicates that this design approach should be scalable to different acoustic frequencies and offers the possibility for a variety of devices based on coordinate transformation.},

Modern digital equipment makes measurements possible with very good reli- ability and background noise immunity. Broadband frequency curves or impulse responses are usually filtered to enable parameter evaluation in octave or one-third octave bands. Impulse responses in small rooms with very Iow reverberation times can be distorted by the application of band filters. However, the objective characterization of the subjective listening effect of single number quantities in frequency bands is quite different from the well- known criteria in room acoustics: reverberation time, clarity, center time, lateral energy fraction, and so forth. In small rooms, other criteria are relevant, particularly the temporal structure of the early reflections, the cut-off fre- quency of the room, the distribution of room resonances, and the corresponding effect of sound coloration.},

abstract = {A variety of methods are available for implementing time-varying digital filters for musical applications. The considerations for mu- sical applications differ from those of other applications, such as speech coding. This domain requires realtime parametric control of a filter such as an equalizer, allowing parameters to vary each sample, e.g. by user interaction, a low-frequency oscillator (LFO), or an envelope. It is desirable to find a filter structure that is time- varying stable, artifact-free, computationally efficient, easily sup- ports arbitrary filter shapes, and yields sensible intermediate filter shapes when interpolating coefficients. It is proposed to use the state variable filter (SVF) for this purpose. A novel proof of its stable time-varying behavior is presented. Equations are derived for matching common equalizer filter shapes, as well as any z- domain transfer function, making the SVF suitable for efficiently implementing any recursive filter. The SVF is compared to state of the art filter structures in an objective evaluation and a subjective listening test. The results confirm that the SVF has good audio quality, while supporting the aforementioned advantageous quali- ties in a time-varying digital filter for music. They also show that a class of time-varying filter techniques useful for speech coding are unsuitable for musical applications.},

abstract = {The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is a simple but powerful numerical method which has been used to perform a wide variety of complex simulations. One of the considerations in using this method is modeling the source of the incident field. When the physical source of acoustic energy is located within the FDTD grid it has typically been modeled as a ‘‘hard'' source for which a source function determines the field at a source node. One drawback of a hard source is that it acts itself as a scatterer. Moreover, its scattering cross section is dictated by the spatial step size within the grid; thus, scattering is independent of the underlying physical size of the source. In this paper a scheme is presented that permits the creation of completely transparent sources. These sources, although more expensive to implement than traditional hard sources, radiate the same field as a hard source, but do not scatter energy.},

abstract = {This thesis describes a system that can be used for the decoding of a three dimensional audio recording over headphones or two, or more, speakers. A literature review of psychoacoustics and a review (both historical and current) of surround sound systems is carried out. The need for a system which is platform independent is discussed, and the proposal for a system based on an amalgamation of Ambisonics, binaural and transaural reproduction schemes is given. In order for this system to function optimally, each of the three systems rely on providing the listener with the relevant psychoacoustic cues. The conversion from a five speaker ITU array to binaural decode is well documented but pair-wise panning algorithms will not produce the correct lateralisation parameters at the ears of a centrally seated listener. Although Ambisonics has been well researched, no one has, as yet, produced a psychoacoustically optimised decoder for the standard irregular five speaker array as specified by the ITU as the original theory, as proposed by Gerzon and Barton (1992) was produced (known as a Vienna decoder), and example solutions given, before the standard had been decided on. In this work, the original work by Gerzon and Barton (1992) is analysed, and shown to be suboptimal, showing a high/low frequency decoder mismatch due to the method of solving the set of non-linear simultaneous equations.},

This gives a better accuracy to CPU-resource ratio in a number of circumstances. The paper focuses on the new formulation and its accuracy.

abstract = {Laplace-domain waveform inversion reconstructs long-wavelength subsurface models by using the zero-frequency component of damped seismic signals. Despite the computational advantages of Laplace-domain waveform inversion over conventional frequency-domain waveform inversion, an acoustic assumption and an iterative matrix solver have been used to invert 3D marine datasets to mitigate the intensive computing cost. In this study, we develop a Laplace-domain waveform modeling and inversion algorithm for 3D acoustic-elastic coupled media by using a parallel sparse direct solver library (MUltifrontal Massively Parallel Solver, MUMPS). We precisely simulate a real marine environment by coupling the 3D acoustic and elastic wave equations with the proper boundary condition at the fluid-solid interface. In addition, we can extract the elastic properties of the Earth below the sea bottom from the recorded acoustic pressure datasets. As a matrix solver, the parallel sparse direct solver is used to factorize the non-symmetric impedance matrix in a distributed memory architecture and rapidly solve the wave field for a number of shots by using the lower and upper matrix factors. Using both synthetic datasets and real datasets obtained by a 3D wide azimuth survey, the long-wavelength component of the P-wave and S-wave velocity models is reconstructed and the proposed modeling and inversion algorithm are verified. A cluster of 80 CPU cores is used for this study.},

abstract = {A particle velocity-strain, finite-difference (FD) method with a perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary condition is developed for the simulation of elastic wave propagation in multidimensional heterogeneous poroelastic media. Instead of the widely used second-order differential equations, a first-order hyperbolic leap-frog system is obtained from Biot's equations. To achieve a high accuracy, the first-order hyperbolic system is discretized on a staggered grid both in time and space. The perfectly matched layer is used at the computational edge to absorb the outgoing waves. The performance of the PML is investigated by calculating the reflection from the boundary. The numerical method is validated by analytical solutions. This FD algorithm is used to study the interaction of elastic waves with a buried land mine. Three cases are simulated for a mine-like object buried in "sand," in purely dry "sand" and in "mud." The results show that the wave responses are significantly different in these cases. The target can be detected by using acoustic measurements after processing.},

The model consists of the tongue, hyoid bone, jaw, larynx complex, bilateral piriform fossae, and vocal tract wall that includes the hard palate, soft palate, pharyngeal wall. In this study, we generated a series of time-varying vocal tract shapes in simulating vowel-vowel (VV) sequence by the 3D articulatory model and analyzed their acoustic characteristics using the finite-difference timedomain (FDTD) method. Area functions (AF) showed that the vocal tract shapes vary smoothly frame by frame, while the transfer functions (TF) transit continuously from vowel to vowel for the first four formants. Acoustic roles of the piriform fossae were also examined. The piriform fossa generated two spectral d ips around 4 kHz in transfer function. Pressure distribution patterns at first four formant frequencies for vowel /a/were examined, which are consistent with previous studies. Experimental results showed that our physiological model can describe the details of the vocal tract.},

abstract = {Reduction of noise is one of the multiple benefits of building envelope greening measures. The potential of wall vegetation systems, green roofs, vegetated low screens at roof edges, and also combinations of such treatments, have been studied by means of combining 2D and 3D full-wave numerical methodologies. This study is concerned with road traffic noise propagation towards the traffic-free sides of inner-city buildings (courtyards). Preserving quietness at such locations has been shown before to be beneficial for the health and well-being of citizens. The results in this study show that green roofs have the highest potential to enhance quietness in courtyards. Favourable combinations of roof shape and green roofs have been identified. Vegetated fa{\{}{\c{c}}{\}}ades are most efficient when applied to narrow city canyons with otherwise acoustically hard fa{\{}{\c{c}}{\}}ade materials. Greening of the upper storey's in the street and (full) fa{\{}{\c{c}}{\}}ades in the courtyard itself is most efficient to achieve noise reduction. Low-height roof screens were shown to be effective when multiple screens are placed, but only on conditions that their faces are absorbing. The combination of different greening measures results in a lower combined effect than when the separate effects would have been linearly added. The combination of green roofs or wall vegetation with roof screens seems most interesting. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, loudspeaker nonlinear distortion is often not taken into account by room correction products and this thesis investigates how distortion can be assessed. The theory of how distortion is produced in loudspeakers and the criteria that governs whether it is perceptible or not is reviewed. Two Matlab graphi- cal user interfaces were developed, one for measuring distortion in loudspeakers and one implementing an algorithm that varies the low frequency cut-off of a loudspeaker depending on the volume level, thus increasing the bass extension possible with small loudspeakers. This method gives good subjective results with small loudspeakers.},

abstract = {The mixing time of room impulse responses denotes the moment when the diffuse re- verberation tail begins. A diffuse (“mixed”) sound field can physically be defined by (1) equidistribution of acoustical energy and (2) a uniform acoustical energy flux over the com- plete solid angle. Accordingly, the perceptual mixing time could be regarded as the moment when the diffuse tail cannot be distinguished from that of any other position or listener's orien- tation in the room. This, for instance, provides an opportunity for reducing the part of binaural room impulse responses that has to be updated dynamically inVirtual Acoustic Environments. Several authors proposed model- and signal-based estimators for the mixing time in rooms. Our study aims at an evaluation of all measures as predictors of a perceptual mixing time. Therefore, we collected binaural impulse response data sets with an adjustable head and torso simulator for a representative sample of rectangular shaped rooms. Altering the transition time into a homogeneous diffuse tail in real time in an adaptive, forced-choice listening test, we determined just audible perceptual mixing times.We evaluated the performance of all potential predictors by linear regression and finally obtained formulae to estimate the perceptual mixing time from measured impulse responses or physical properties of the room.},

abstract = {This is the only book on spectral methods built around MATLAB programs. Along with finite differences and finite elements, spectral methods are one of the three main technologies for solving partial differential equations on computers. Since spectral methods involve significant linear algebra and graphics they are very suitable for the high level programming of MATLAB. This hands-on introduction is built around forty short and powerful MATLAB programs, which the reader can download from the World Wide Web. This book presents the key ideas along with many figures, examples, and short, elegant MATLAB programs for readers to adapt to their own needs. It covers ODE and PDE boundary value problems, eigenvalues and pseudospectra, linear and nonlinear waves, and numerical quadrature.},

As a result one obtains ultrathin (a few angstrom thick) metal-oxide films at the substrate. The surface of the metal-oxide films was found to be rather inhomogeneous. Y and Cu ions remain quantitatively at the substrate despite the heating procedure. A linear dependence between area density of the metal ions in the oxidized films and the number of monolayers of the LB films was observed. The preparation of a mixed metal-oxide film containing Y, Ba, Cu with a given stoichiometry was found to be difficult due to the effect of counter ion exchange. The samples were investigated by means of plasma-desorption and spontaneous-desorption mass spectrometry, by Rutherford back-scattering and electron microscopy.},

abstract = {This paper describes a software package for auralisation in inter- active virtual reality environments. Its purpose is to reproduce, in real time, the 3D soundﬁeld within a virtual room where lis- tener and sound sources can be moved freely. Output sound is pre- sented binaurally using headphones. Auralisation is based on geo- metric acoustic models combined with head-related transfer func- tions (HRTFs): the direct sound and reﬂections from each source are computed dynamically by the image-source method. Direc- tional cues are obtained by ﬁltering these incoming sounds by the HRTFs corresponding to their propagation directions relative to the listener, computed on the basis of the information provided by a head-tracking device. Two interactive real-time applications were developed to demonstrate the operation of this software pack- age. Both provide a visual representation of listener (position and head orientation) and sources (including image sources). One fo- cusses on the auralisation-visualisation synchrony and the other on the dynamic calculation of reﬂection paths. Computational perfor- mance results of the auralisation system are presented.},

abstract = {Finite-difference time-domain(FDTD) simulation has been a popular area of research in room acoustics due to its capability to simulate wave phenomena in a wide bandwidth directly in the time-domain. A downside of the method is that it introduces a direction and frequency dependent error to the simulated sound field due to the non-linear dispersion relation of the discrete system. In this study, the perceptual threshold of the dispersion error is measured in three-dimensional FDTD schemes as a function of simulation distance. Dispersion error is evaluated for three different explicit, non-staggered FDTD schemes using the numerical wavenumber in the direction of the worst-case error of each scheme. It is found that the thresholds for the different schemes do not vary significantly when the phase velocity error level is fixed. The thresholds are found to vary significantly between the different sound samples. The measured threshold for the audibility of dispersion error at the probability level of 82{\{}{\%}{\}} correct discrimination for three-alternative forced choice is found to be 9.1 m of propagation in a free field, that leads to a maximum group delay error of 1.8 ms at 20 kHz with the chosen phase velocity error level of 2{\{}{\%}{\}}.},

abstract = {A synthesis of two newly developed concepts in 3-D modeling is developed in this paper: (1) The open. (non complete) seismic model, and (2) the ray tracing based wavefront (WF) construction method. The open model may contain interfaces with holes and other missing parts, which simplifies model building considerably because the input horizon data from standard interpretation and processing packages are often incomplete. A set of volumes is defined in the model. A volume is a logical unit that points to a set of property functions, e.g., P-velocity, S-velocity, and density. The properties are represented either as constants or as B-spline functions of the spatial coordinates (x, y) or (x, y, z). The volumes of the model are assigned to opposing sides of each interface and not to specific spatial areas of the model, which is the case in most (blocky) model representations. The interfaces are given explicitly by triangular grids where the sizes of the triangles are determined locally by the curvature of the interface.|We show how modeling by WF construction is both possible and computationally efficient in open models, but only after some modifications to deal with the ambiguity of the model representation. It is not possible to find a unique volume for the spatial positions in an open model. Instead, the volumes (with associated velocities, etc.) are determined from the last interface encountered by each ray in the WE To find an arrival in a receiver, the volume associated to the receiver has to match the volume of the WF hitting the receiver.},

abstract = {This thesis describes a system that can be used for the decoding of a three dimensional audio recording over headphones or two, or more, speakers. A literature review of psychoacoustics and a review (both historical and current) of surround sound systems is carried out. The need for a system which is platform independent is discussed, and the proposal for a system based on an amalgamation of Ambisonics, binaural and transaural reproduction schemes is given. In order for this system to function optimally, each of the three systems rely on providing the listener with the relevant psychoacoustic cues. The conversion from a five speaker ITU array to binaural decode is well documented but pair-wise panning algorithms will not produce the correct lateralisation parameters at the ears of a centrally seated listener. Although Ambisonics has been well researched, no one has, as yet, produced a psychoacoustically optimised decoder for the standard irregular five speaker array as specified by the ITU as the original theory, as proposed by Gerzon and Barton (1992) was produced (known as a Vienna decoder), and example solutions given, before the standard had been decided on. In this work, the original work by Gerzon and Barton (1992) is analysed, and shown to be suboptimal, showing a high/low frequency decoder mismatch due to the method of solving the set of non-linear simultaneous equations.},

abstract = {The finite-difference time-domain method is a simple but powerful numerical method for simulating full-wave acoustic propagation and scattering. However, the method can demand a large amount of computational resources. Traditionally, continuously curved boundaries are represented in a stair-step fashion and thus accurately modeling scattering from a boundary will require a finer discretization than would otherwise be necessary for modeling propagation in a homogeneous medium. However, a fine discretization might not be practical due to limited computational resources. A locally conformal technique is presented here for modeling acoustic scattering from continuously curved rigid boundaries. This technique is low cost, simple to implement, and gives better results for the same grid discretization than the traditional stair-step representation. These improvements can be traded for a coarser discretization which reduces the computational burden. The improved accuracy of this technique is demonstrated for a spherical scatterer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli is the most frequent pathogen in both acute bacterial prostatitis and acute uncomplicated urinary infections. To assess the virulence profiles of E. coli in acute prostatitis, the serotypes and virulence factor (VF) genotypes were determined. METHODS: We studied 107 E. coli isolates from cases of acute bacterial prostatitis, 76 isolates from acute pyelonephritis, 194 isolates from acute Cystitis and 80 fecal isolates from healthy people. All pyelonephritis and cystitis isolates were from women. Seven urovirulence determinants were analyzed by DNA colony hybridization, including the genes for type 1 fimbria (pil), P fimbria (pap), S fimbria (sfa), afimbrial adhesin AFA-I (afaI), alpha-hemolysin (hly), cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1) and aerobactin (aer). O:H:K serotypes were also determined. RESULTS: With the exception of pil and afaI, all VFs were significantly more often associated with prostatitis, pyelonephritis and cystitis isolates than with the fecal isolates. The prevalence of sfa, hly and cnf1 was higher in prostatitis isolates than in pyelonephritis and cystitis isolates, and the pap+sfa+hly+cnf1+ genotype was dominant among prostatitis isolates (48.8{\{}{\%}{\}}). Nine O serotype (O1, O2, O4, O6, O16, O18, O22, O25 and O75) accounted for 79.4{\{}{\%}{\}}, 73.7{\{}{\%}{\}} and 78.4{\{}{\%}{\}} of the prostatitis, pyelonephritis and cystitis strains, respectively. There was an apparent correlation between serotype and genotype in uropathogenic E. coli. CONCLUSION: The predominance of O serotypes in female urinary tract infections and a high percentage of multiple VFs among the prostatitis isolates suggested that VFs play important roles in the pathogenesis of acute bacterial prostatitis.},

However, loudspeaker nonlinear distortion is often not taken into account by room correction products and this thesis investigates how distortion can be assessed. The theory of how distortion is produced in loudspeakers and the criteria that governs whether it is perceptible or not is reviewed. Two Matlab graphi- cal user interfaces were developed, one for measuring distortion in loudspeakers and one implementing an algorithm that varies the low frequency cut-off of a loudspeaker depending on the volume level, thus increasing the bass extension possible with small loudspeakers. This method gives good subjective results with small loudspeakers.},

Instead of the finite difference approximation in the conventional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, this technique uses trigonometric functions, through an FFT (fast Fourier transform) algorithm, to represent the spatial derivatives in partial differential equations. Traditionally the Fourier pseudospectral method is used only for spatially periodic problems because the use of FFT implies periodicity. In order to overcome this limitation, the perfectly matched layer is used to attenuate the waves from other periods, thus allowing the method to be applicable to unbounded media. This new algorithm, referred to as the pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) algorithm, is developed to solve large-scale problems for acoustic waves. It has an infinite order of accuracy in the spatial derivatives, and thus requires much fewer unknowns than the conventional FDTD method. Numerical results confirms the efficacy of the PSTD method.},

abstract = {Galerkin (spectral) methods for numerical simulation of incompressible flows within simple boundaries are shown to possess many advantages over existing finite-difference methods. In this paper, the accuracy of Galerkin approximations obtained from truncated Fourier expansions is explored. Accuracy of simulation is tested empirically using a simple scalar-convection test problem and the Taylor–Green vortex-decay problem. It is demonstrated empirically that the Galerkin (Fourier) equations involving {\$}N{\^{}}p{\$} degrees of freedom, where {\$}p{\$} is the number of space dimensions, give simulations at least as accurate as finite-difference simulations involving {\$}(2N){\^{}}p{\$} degrees of freedom. The theoretical basis for the improved accuracy of the Galerkin (Fourier) method is explained. In particular, the nature of aliasing errors is examined in detail. It is shown that ‘aliasing' errors need not be errors at all, but that aliasing should be avoided in flow simulations. An eigenvalue analysis of schemes for simulation of passive scalar convection supplies the mathematical basis for the improved accuracy of the Galerkin (Fourier) method. A comparison is made of the computational efficiency of Galerkin and finite-difference simulations, and a survey is given of those problems where Galerkin methods are likely to be applied most usefully. We conclude that numerical simulation of many of the flows of current interest is done most efficiently and accurately using the spectral methods advocated here.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a technique for time-domain electromagnetic inverse scattering based upon the use of a two-dimensional, finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) forward scattering field representation in numerical feedback loop with a nonlinear optimization routine. Causality is exploited to reconstruct the actual target surface contour in a sequential and cumulative manner as the illuminating wavefront sweeps across the target. This approach appears to require a minimum amount of scattered field information. A number of examples are reported where the only data needed is the time waveform of a scattered pulse for the transverse magnetic (TM) polarization case, observed at just a single point in the near field. These examples include the reconstruction of two-dimensional conducting and homogeneous dielectric target shapes such as triangles, rectangles, and trapezoids. A dielectric target with reentrant features, resembling the letter "J" is also reconstructed from a single point observation. The effects of measurement signal-to-noise ratio upon this inverse-scattering technique are determined via numerical experiments. These effects are discussed in two contexts: 1) probability of exact reconstruction vs. signal-to-noise ratio, and 2) sensitivity of reconstructions to noise. It is shown that, even at low signal-to-noise ratios (where the probability of exact reconstruction is also low), the imperfectly-reconstructed targets retain many of the distinguishing features of the original target. This indicates that the reconstruction process is quite robust relative to noise. Developments in nonlinear optimization appear promising for further improving the reliability and quality of target reconstruction in noise.},

The test involves: (1) an appropriate experimental design; (2) an inoculation procedure; (3) a test procedure; and (4) interpretation of results; The results are evaluated in relation to set safety criteria and, if satisfactory, should be confirmed under field conditions (verification).

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Some attention is paid in this paper to a few of the key problems involved in applying FDTD: frequency-dependent boundary conditions, non-Cartesian grids, and numerical error. Possible applications are illustrated with an example. An interesting approach lies in using the FDTD simulation to adapt a digital filter to represent the acoustical transfer function from source to observer, as accurately as possible. The approximate digital filter can be used for auralization experiments.},

Investigating alpha modulation during active cognitive processing may provide a more targeted means of relating aberrant alpha activity to specific aspects of depression symptomatology. Alpha activity is reliably modulated during working memory (WM) processing and WM impairments are a common neuropsychological consequence of MDD. Moreover, it has been suggested that alpha activity reflects internally mediated inhibitory process and attenuated inhibition has been suggested to contribute to WM inefficacy.},

abstract = {The modeling of room acoustics and simulation of sound wave propagation remain a difficult and computationally expensive task. Two main techniques have evolved, with one focusing on a real physical - wave-oriented - sound propagation, while the other ap- proximates sound waves as rays using raytracing techniques. Due to many advances in computer science, and especially computer graphics over the last decade, interactive 3D sound simulations for complex and dynamic environments are within reach. In this paper we analyze sound propagation in terms of acoustic energy and explore the possibilities to map these concepts to ra- diometry and graphics rendering equations. Although we concen- trate on ray-based techniques, we also partially consider wave- based sound propagation effects. The implemented system ex- ploits modern graphics hardware and rendering techniques and is able to efficiently simulate 3D room acoustics, as well as to mea- sure simplified personal HRTFs through acoustic raytracing.},

abstract = {Stochastic mechanisms are ubiquitous in biological systems. Biochemical reactions that involve small numbers of molecules are intrinsically noisy, being dominated by large concentration fluctuations1, 2, 3. This intrinsic noise has been implicated in the random lysis/lysogeny decision of bacteriophage-4, in the loss of synchrony of circadian clocks5, 6 and in the decrease of precision of cell signals7. We sought to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence of molecular fluctuations within single cells (biochemical noise) could explain the variation of gene expression levels between cells in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise). We have isolated the biochemical contribution to phenotypic noise from that of other noise sources by carrying out a series of differential measurements. We varied independently the rates of transcription and translation of a single fluorescent reporter gene in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis, and we quantitatively measured the resulting changes in the phenotypic noise characteristics. We report that of these two parameters, increased translational efficiency is the predominant source of increased phenotypic noise. This effect is consistent with a stochastic model of gene expression in which proteins are produced in random and sharp bursts. Our results thus provide the first direct experimental evidence of the biochemical origin of phenotypic noise, demonstrating that the level of phenotypic variation in an isogenic population can be regulated by genetic parameters.},

As a direct time-domain simulation, suitable for large modeling regions, the technique seems a good "brute force" approach for solving room acoustic problems. Some attention is paid in this paper to a few of the key problems involved in applying FDTD: frequency-dependent boundary conditions, non-Cartesian grids, and numerical error. Possible applications are illustrated with an example. An interesting approach lies in using the FDTD simulation to adapt a digital filter to represent the acoustical transfer function from source to observer, as accurately as possible. The approximate digital filter can be used for auralization experiments. ¸ 1995 Acoustical Society of America. PACS},

abstract = {A single room impulse response can reveal information about the acoustics of a given space in both objective, and, when used for auralization, subjective terms. However, for additional spatial information, or more accurate and perceptually convincing auralization, multiple impulse responses are needed. Higher order Ambisonics is a robust means of capturing the spatial qualities of an acoustic space over multiple channels for decoding and rendering over many possible speaker layouts. A method for obtaining {\{}{\$}{\}}N{\{}{\$}{\}}th-order Ambisonic impulse responses from a room acoustic model, based on lower orders using differential microphone techniques is presented. This is tested using a third-order encoding of a 2-D finite difference time domain room acoustic simulation based on multiple circular arrays of receivers. Accurate channel directional profiles are obtained and results are verified in a series of listening tests comparing the localization of a sound source placed within the given simulation to the same source encoded directly. This generic encoding scheme can be applied to any room acoustic simulation technique where it is possible to obtain impulse responses across multiple receiver positions. Although the proposed method encompasses horizontal encoding only, it can also be applied directly in 3-D simulations where height information is not required in the final auralization.},

The amount of numerical reflection of PMLs has been studied numerically and analytically for low order stencils but not systematically at higher order, nor for the pseudo-spectral scheme. In this paper, we extend the theoretical and numerical analysis of the coefficient of reflection of PML layers to solvers of any order of accuracy. Results show that the PML efficiency is preserved at any order, including at the infinite order limit that is attained by the pseudo-spectral formulation.},

All perturbed PRTFs were compared with the baseline set, in order to precisely quantify the frequency shifts in all the spectral peaks and notches up to 14 kHz. This paper focuses on the pinna sensitivity patterns for the first spectral notch N1, known to be an auditory cue to elevation in the median plane. In particular, N1 sensitivity patterns revealed the elevation dependence of broad areas of the pinna's upper structures that are involved in reflection, and the role of the tragus region involved in diffraction.},

abstract = {The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is a simple but powerful numerical method which has been used to perform a wide variety of complex simulations. One of the considerations in using this method is modeling the source of the incident field. When the physical source of acoustic energy is located within the FDTD grid it has typically been modeled as a ‘‘hard'' source for which a source function determines the field at a source node. One drawback of a hard source is that it acts itself as a scatterer. Moreover, its scattering cross section is dictated by the spatial step size within the grid; thus, scattering is independent of the underlying physical size of the source. In this paper a scheme is presented that permits the creation of completely transparent sources. These sources, although more expensive to implement than traditional hard sources, radiate the same field as a hard source, but do not scatter energy.},

This technique is useful in signal processing or psychoacoustic studies. The entire process is carried out on a digital computer so that a wide range of room parameters can be studied with accurate control over the experimental conditions.

Research on room acoustic simulation focuses on a more accurate modeling of propagation effects such as diffraction and other wave effects in rooms, and on scattering. Much progress was made in this field so that wave models also (for example, the boundary element method and the finite differences in time domain) can now be used for higher frequencies. The concepts and implementations of room simulation methods are briefly reviewed. After all, simulations in architectural acoustics are indeed powerful tools, but their reliability depends on the skills of the operator who has to create an adequate polygon model and has to choose the correct input data of boundary conditions such as absorption and scattering. Very little is known about the uncertainty of this input data. With the theory of error propagation of uncertainties it can be shown that prediction of reverberation times with accuracy better than the just noticeable difference requires input data in a quality which is not available from reverberation room measurements.},

abstract = {Acoustic signals pass through numerous transforms in the auditory system before perceptual attributes such as loudness and pitch are derived. However, relatively little is known as to exactly when these transformations happen, and where, cortically or sub-cortically, they occur. In an effort to examine this, we investigated the latencies and locations of cortical entrainment to two transforms predicted by a model of loudness perception for time-varying sounds: the transforms were instantaneous loudness and short-term loudness, where the latter is hypothesized to be derived from the former and therefore should occur later in time. Entrainment of cortical activity was estimated from electro- and magneto-encephalographic (EMEG) activity, recorded while healthy subjects listened to continuous speech. There was entrainment to instantaneous loudness bilaterally at 45, 100, and 165 ms, in Heschl's gyrus, dorsal lateral sulcus, and Heschl's gyrus, respectively. Entrainment to short-term loudness was found in both the dorsal lateral sulcus and superior temporal sulcus at 275 ms. These results suggest that short-term loudness is derived from instantaneous loudness, and that this derivation occurs after processing in sub-cortical structures.},

Hearing-impaired listeners were asked to rate the perceived quality of speech and music that had been subjected to various forms of nonlinear distortion, some of which are inherent to certain hearing aid designs including (1) hard and soft, symmetrical and asymmetrical clipping; (2) center clipping; (3) "full-range" distortion, produced by raising the absolute magnitude of the instantaneous amplitude of the signal to a power (8800;1), while preserving the signal of the amplitude; (4) automatic gain control (AGC); (5) output limiting. Stimuli were subjected to frequency-dependent amplification as prescribed by the "Cambridge formula" before presentation via Sennheiser HD580 earphones. The pattern of the rating was reasonably consistent across subjects with only two of ten subjects not making consistent ratings. The mean ratings were not lower with increasing amount of soft or center clipping or when the compression ratios of the AGC and output limiting were increased. The deleterious effects produced by these nonlinear distortions may have been offset by the beneficial effects of improving audibility and compensating for loudness recruitment.

abstract = {An efficient reverberator structure is proposed for approximating measured reverberation. A fixed convolution matching the early portion of a measured impulse response is crossfaded with a switched convolution reverberator drawing its switched convolution section from the late-field of the measured impulse response. In this way, the early portion of the measured impulse response is precisely re- produced, and the late-field equalization and decay rates efficiently approximated. To use segments of the measured impulse response, the switched convolution structure is modified to include a normal- ization filter to account for the decay of the late-field between the nominal fixed/switched crossfade time and the time of the selected segment. Further, the measured impulse response late-field is ex- tended below its noise floor in anticipation of the normalization. This structure provides psychoacoustically accurate synthesis of the measured impulse response using less than half a second of convolution, irrespective of the length of the measured impulse re- sponse. In addition, the structure provides direct control over the equalization and late-field frequency dependent decay rate. Emu- lations of EMT 140 plate reverberator and marble lobby impulse responses are presented.},

abstract = {The first artificial reverberation algorithms were proposed in the early 1960s, and new, improved algorithms are published regularly. These algorithms have been widely used in music production since the 1970s, and now find applications in new fields, such as game audio. This overview article provides a unified review of the various approaches to digital artificial reverberation. The three main categories have been delay networks, convolution-based algorithms, and physical room models. Delay-network and convolution techniques have been competing in popularity in the music technology field, and are often employed to produce a desired perceptual or artistic effect. In applications including virtual reality, predictive acoustic modeling, and computer-aided design of acoustic spaces, accuracy is desired, and physical models have been mainly used, although, due to their computational complexity, they are currently mainly used for simplified geometries or to generate reverberation impulse responses for use with a convolution method. With the increase of computing power, all these approaches will be available in real time. A recent trend in audio technology is the emulation of analog artificial reverberation units, such as spring reverberators, using signal processing algorithms. As a case study we present an improved parametric model for a spring reverberation unit.},

While interactive geometrical approaches can be used for more accurate acoustical modeling, the increased authoring complexity and the additional cost of geometrical calculations still appears to overshadow their potential benefits. This paper presents solutions to integrate off-line geometrical acoustic modeling in game environments. By pre-computing image-source gradients for early reflections and directional decay profiles, we can generate location dependent reverberation effects without storing or accessing the actual geometry at run-time. We render such reverberation effects using a frequency-domain scalable processing approach. In this context, we introduce an efficient prioritization scheme and evaluate alternative transforms for late reverberation processing. Our pipeline enables fine-grain rendering of distance and surface proximity effects and modeling of both outdoor and coupled indoor spaces with arbitrary reverberation decay profiles},

abstract = {A rather novel approach to predict jet noise is the stochastic noise generation and radiation (SNGR) method. The SNGR method uses the linearized Eider equations as an acoustic analogy together with source terms that are modeled. Previously, source terms for the linearized Euler equations have been derived and presented by Goldstein (Goldstein, M. E., "A Unified Approach to Some Recent Developments in Jet Noise Theory," International Journal of Aeroacoustics, Vol. 1, No. 1, 2002, pp. 1-16), as well as Bailly et al. (Bailly, C., Lafon, P., and Candel, S. M., "A Stochastic Approach to Compute Noise Generation and Radiation of Free Turbulent Flows," AIAA Paper 95-092, June 1995). Two different nonconservative formulations of the inhomogeneous linearized Eider equations are presented in these previous studies. Because the linearized Euler equations in conservative form are used in the present work, new source terms have to be derived for the conservative set of equations. A formal derivation of source terms for the linearized Eider equations in conservative form is presented, and the system of equations is compared to those of Goldstein and Bailly et al. Simplified versions of the derived source terms are also developed. To test the derived source terms, a direct simulation of a forced two-dimensional mixing layer is carried out. The direct simulation provides the mean flow and source field for the inhomogeneous linearized Eider equations. The solutions to the linearized Euler equations with source terms are compared to the solution of the direct simulation and show good agreement. All simulations are performed using Tam and Webb's fourth-order dispersion-relation-preserving scheme and a four-step fourth-order Runge-Kutta time-marching technique. Artificial selective damping introduced through the numerical scheme is used to avoid spurious waves. Absorbing boundary conditions based on characteristic variables are used at the free boundaries and a buffer layer is added at the outflow.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been growing interest in modeling sound propagation in complex, three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments. With diverse applications for the military, the gaming industry, psychoacoustics researchers, architectural acousticians, and others, advances in computing power and 3D audio-rendering techniques have driven research and development aimed at closing the gap between the auralization and visualization of virtual spaces. To this end, this thesis focuses on improving the physical and perceptual realism of sound-field simulations in virtual environments through advances in edge-diffraction modeling. To model sound propagation in virtual environments, acoustical simulation tools commonly rely on geometrical-acoustics (GA) techniques that assume asymptotically high frequencies, large flat surfaces, and infinitely thin ray-like propagation paths. Such techniques can be augmented with diffraction modeling to compensate for the effect of surface size on the strength and directivity of a reflection, to allow for propagation around obstacles and into shadow zones, and to maintain sound-field continuity across reflection and shadow boundaries. Using a time-domain, line-integral formulation of the Biot-Tolstoy-Medwin (BTM) diffraction expression, this thesis explores various aspects of diffraction calculations for virtual-acoustic simulations. Specifically, we first analyze the periodic singularity of the BTM integrand and describe the relationship between the singularities and higher-order reflections within wedges with open angle less than 180 degrees. Coupled with analytical approximations for the BTM expression, this analysis allows for accurate numerical computations and a continuous sound field in the vicinity of an arbitrary wedge geometry insonified by a point source. Second, we describe an edge-subdivision strategy that allows for fast diffraction calculations with low error relative to a numerically more accurate solution. Third, to address the considerable increase in propagation paths due to diffraction, we describe a simple procedure for identifying and culling insignificant diffraction components during a virtual-acoustic simulation. Finally, we present a novel method to find GA components using diffraction parameters that ensures continuity at reflection and shadow boundaries.},

The new method is the extension of the classic auralization process based on the linear convolution of the "dry" original signal with the impulse response of the system. The extension allows for the emulation of non-linear systems, characterized in terms of harmonic distortion at several orders. The work first presents the mathematical framework of the proposed implementation, then it is shown how a not linear system can be experimentally characterized by a new measurement method of multiple impulse responses at various harmonic orders, and finally it is shown how these impulse responses can be employed in a multiple convolution process: an experimental demonstration is given of the similarity of the numerically processed sound with the live recording coming from a highly distorting device.},

An in-depth sub- jective study is presented on NLD-specific distortion linked to perception and bass-intensity enhancement and then extended to correlate the Rnonlin distortion model to subjective data. Nonlinear regression computes Rnonlin-equation coefficients to enable a metric for audibility of NLD-dependent distortion. Recommendations follow for NLD sets that achieve good bass performance with low perceived distortion.},

As a relatively simple example, chaotic oscillations in low-pressure thermionic discharges are discussed in detail. Period doubling bifurcations and intermittency are clearly identified as standard routes to chaotic behaviour. Most of its dynamical features are well described by simple nonlinear oscillator models. In contrast, plasma waves are spatiotemporal phenomena and thus show a much richer dynamical behaviour. This is demonstrated for current-driven drift waves in a linear magnetized plasma. Probe arrays provide the required information about the time evolution of the azimuthal wave structure.},

abstract = {The mixing time of room impulse responses denotes the moment when the diffuse re- verberation tail begins. A diffuse (“mixed”) sound field can physically be defined by (1) equidistribution of acoustical energy and (2) a uniform acoustical energy flux over the com- plete solid angle. Accordingly, the perceptual mixing time could be regarded as the moment when the diffuse tail cannot be distinguished from that of any other position or listener's orien- tation in the room. This, for instance, provides an opportunity for reducing the part of binaural room impulse responses that has to be updated dynamically inVirtual Acoustic Environments. Several authors proposed model- and signal-based estimators for the mixing time in rooms. Our study aims at an evaluation of all measures as predictors of a perceptual mixing time. Therefore, we collected binaural impulse response data sets with an adjustable head and torso simulator for a representative sample of rectangular shaped rooms. Altering the transition time into a homogeneous diffuse tail in real time in an adaptive, forced-choice listening test, we determined just audible perceptual mixing times.We evaluated the performance of all potential predictors by linear regression and finally obtained formulae to estimate the perceptual mixing time from measured impulse responses or physical properties of the room.},

Novel FDTD formulations of simple locally reacting wall models with complex impedance are proposed and analysed in terms of pressure wave reflectance for different wall impedances and angles of incidence. The analysis is done using both numerical experiments and analytic evaluation. For the numerical experiments, a compact implicit scheme of 4th-order accuracy is used for updating the room interior grid points, the results of which are analysed in both time and frequency domains. The simulation results show that the 2D frequency-dependent locally reacting wall models adhere well to their theoretical counterparts, particularly at low frequencies. Furthermore, they validate the analytic evaluation method, which paves the way for using either method as a tool for analysis of numerical reflectance.},

Looking a little closer at it's derivation we can show that it is in fact a toolbox of interrelated techniques that the games community can use to good effect. The results are compelling and the code to compute them is actually straightforward to write, but the paper that introduces it assumes a lot of background knowledge from the first time reader. This paper is an attempt to provide this background, add some insights into the “why” questions, and hopefully give you all you need to add SH lighting to your game.},

abstract = {Reduction of noise is one of the multiple benefits of building envelope greening measures. The potential of wall vegetation systems, green roofs, vegetated low screens at roof edges, and also combinations of such treatments, have been studied by means of combining 2D and 3D full-wave numerical methodologies. This study is concerned with road traffic noise propagation towards the traffic-free sides of inner-city buildings (courtyards). Preserving quietness at such locations has been shown before to be beneficial for the health and well-being of citizens. The results in this study show that green roofs have the highest potential to enhance quietness in courtyards. Favourable combinations of roof shape and green roofs have been identified. Vegetated fa{\c{c}}ades are most efficient when applied to narrow city canyons with otherwise acoustically hard fa{\c{c}}ade materials. Greening of the upper storey's in the street and (full) fa{\c{c}}ades in the courtyard itself is most efficient to achieve noise reduction. Low-height roof screens were shown to be effective when multiple screens are placed, but only on conditions that their faces are absorbing. The combination of different greening measures results in a lower combined effect than when the separate effects would have been linearly added. The combination of green roofs or wall vegetation with roof screens seems most interesting. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper considers source excitation strategies in finite difference time domain room acoustics simulations for auralization purposes. We demonstrate that FDTD simulations can be conducted to obtain impulse responses based on unit impulse excitation, this being the shortest, simplest and most efficiently implemented signal that might be applied. Single, rather than double, precision accuracy simulations might be implemented where memory use is critical but the consequence is a remarkably increased noise floor. Hard source excitation introduces a discontinuity in the simulated acoustic field resulting in a shift of resonant modes from expected values. Additive sources do not introduce such discontinuities, but instead result in a broadband offset across the frequency spectrum. Transparent sources address both of these issues and with unit impulse excitation the calculation of the compensation filters required to implement transparency is also simplified. However, both transparent and additive source excitation demonstrate solution growth problems for a bounded space. Any of these approaches might be used if the consequences are understood and compensated for, however, for room acoustics simulation the hard source is the least favorable due to the fundamental changes it imparts on the underlying geometry. These methods are further tested through the implementation of a directional sound source based on multiple omnidirectional point sources. ?? 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Sound fields in small rooms are generally characterized by impulse responses and transfer functions, as are oth- er linear and time invariant systems. Modern digital equipment makes measurements possible with very good reli- ability and background noise immunity. Broadband frequency curves or impulse responses are usually filtered to enable parameter evaluation in octave or one-third octave bands. Impulse responses in small rooms with very Iow reverberation times can be distorted by the application of band filters. However, the objective characterization of the subjective listening effect of single number quantities in frequency bands is quite different from the well- known criteria in room acoustics: reverberation time, clarity, center time, lateral energy fraction, and so forth. In small rooms, other criteria are relevant, particularly the temporal structure of the early reflections, the cut-off fre- quency of the room, the distribution of room resonances, and the corresponding effect of sound coloration.},

abstract = {Stochastic mechanisms are ubiquitous in biological systems. Biochemical reactions that involve small numbers of molecules are intrinsically noisy, being dominated by large concentration fluctuations1, 2, 3. This intrinsic noise has been implicated in the random lysis/lysogeny decision of bacteriophage-4, in the loss of synchrony of circadian clocks5, 6 and in the decrease of precision of cell signals7. We sought to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence of molecular fluctuations within single cells (biochemical noise) could explain the variation of gene expression levels between cells in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise). We have isolated the biochemical contribution to phenotypic noise from that of other noise sources by carrying out a series of differential measurements. We varied independently the rates of transcription and translation of a single fluorescent reporter gene in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis, and we quantitatively measured the resulting changes in the phenotypic noise characteristics. We report that of these two parameters, increased translational efficiency is the predominant source of increased phenotypic noise. This effect is consistent with a stochastic model of gene expression in which proteins are produced in random and sharp bursts. Our results thus provide the first direct experimental evidence of the biochemical origin of phenotypic noise, demonstrating that the level of phenotypic variation in an isogenic population can be regulated by genetic parameters.},

abstract = {Large-scale simulations of ultrasonic waves in heterogeneous tissue models are useful in biomedical R{\&}D for imaging and therapeutics. The scale of bioacoustic models is hundreds of wavelengths. Typical 2D wave solvers are not practical at this scale, and 3D is out of the question, because of numerical errors and/or computer limits. To achieve much higher performance we use the periodic pseudospectral (PS) method, where spatial derivatives are calculated from FFTs over Cartesian grids. With a 4th order explicit time integrator, the PS method yields the necessary accuracy and efficiency. However, the domain must be periodic. We show how to circumvent this intrinsic limitation with Berenger's perfectly matched layer (PML) on the boundaries. High accuracy, computational efficiency, and parallelism are demonstrated and a large-scale bioacoustic model is calculated. Generalizations of the method are described, including attenuation and nonlinearity},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with pain, reduced grip strength, loss of range of motion and joint stiffness leading to impaired hand function and difficulty with daily activities. The effectiveness of different rehabilitation interventions on specific treatment goals has not yet been fully explored. The objective of this systematic review is to provide evidence based knowledge on the treatment effects of different rehabilitation interventions for specific treatment goals for hand OA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A computerized literature search of Medline, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ISI Web of Science, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and SCOPUS was performed. Studies that had an evidence level of 2b or higher and that compared a rehabilitation intervention with a control group and assessed at least one of the following outcome measures - pain, physical hand function or other measures of hand impairment - were included. The eligibility and methodological quality of trials were systematically assessed by two independent reviewers using the PEDro scale. Treatment effects were calculated using standardized mean difference and 95{\%} confidence intervals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Ten studies, of which six were of higher quality (PEDro score {\textgreater}6), were included. The rehabilitation techniques reviewed included three studies on exercise, two studies each on laser and heat, and one study each on splints, massage and acupuncture. One higher quality trial showed a large positive effect of 12-month use of a night splint on hand pain, function, strength and range of motion. Exercise had no effect on hand pain or function although it may be able to improve hand strength. Low level laser therapy may be useful for improving range of motion. No rehabilitation interventions were found to improve stiffness.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: There is emerging high quality evidence to support that rehabilitation interventions can offer significant benefits to individuals with hand OA. A summary of the higher quality evidence is provided to assist with clinical decision making based on current evidence. Further high-quality research is needed concerning the effects of rehabilitation interventions on specific treatment goals for hand OA.},

abstract = {Finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) calculations are typically performed with partial differential equations that are first order in time. Equation sets appropriate for FDTD calculations in a moving inhomogeneous medium (with an emphasis on the atmosphere) are derived and discussed in this paper. Two candidate equation sets, both derived from linearized equations of fluid dynamics, are proposed. The first, which contains three coupled equations for the sound pressure, vector acoustic velocity, and acoustic density, is obtained without any approximations. The second, which contains two coupled equations for the sound pressure and vector acoustic velocity, is derived by ignoring terms proportional to the divergence of the medium velocity and the gradient of the ambient pressure. It is shown that the second set has the same or a wider range of applicability than equations for the sound pressure that have been previously used for analytical and numerical studies of sound propagation in a moving atmosphere. Practical FDTD implementation of the second set of equations is discussed. Results show good agreement with theoretical predictions of the sound pressure due to a point monochromatic source in a uniform, high Mach number flow and with Fast Field Program calculations of sound propagation in a stratified moving atmosphere.},

abstract = {Higher Order Ambisonics have been increasingly investigated in the past years, and found promising as a rational, scalable and flexible way to encode, transmit and render 3D sound fields. Nevertheless, studies concerning virtual source imaging or natural 3D sound encoding mainly focussed on the directional encoding of plane waves, and neglected the near field effect of finite distance sources though it's present in any ordinary sound field. This paper highlights that with near field, the infinite bass-boost affecting ambisonic components makes the currently accepted format unviable. By introducing from the encoding stage a near field compensation of reproduction loudspeakers, a viable, modified ambisonic format is defined, distance-coding filters are designed, and higher order ambisonic recording and synthesis become practicable.},

Therefore, the accurate simulation of the acoustic characteristics of a boundary is an important part of any room acoustics prediction model, and in particular diffuse reflections at a boundary is one of the most important properties to model correctly for an accurate and perceptually natural result. This paper presents a comparison of two simulation models for the phenomenon of diffuse reflection at a boundary: one based on introducing physical variations at the boundary itself, and another based on the use of a diffusion equation model.},

Nevertheless, studies concerning virtual source imaging or natural 3D sound encoding mainly focussed on the directional encoding of plane waves, and neglected the near field effect of finite distance sources though it's present in any ordinary sound field. This paper highlights that with near field, the infinite bass-boost affecting ambisonic components makes the currently accepted format unviable. By introducing from the encoding stage a near field compensation of reproduction loudspeakers, a viable, modified ambisonic format is defined, distance-coding filters are designed, and higher order ambisonic recording and synthesis become practicable.},

abstract = {When a sound producing device such as insert earphones or a hearing aid is sealed in the ear canal, the fact that only a tiny segment of the sound wave can exist in this small volume at any given instant, produces an oscillation of the static pressure in the ear canal. This effect can greatly boosts the SPL in the ear canal, especially at low frequencies, a phenomena which we call Trapped Volume Insertion Gain (TVIG). In this study the TVIG has been found by numerical modeling as well as direct measurements using a Zwislocki coupler and the ear of a human subject, to be as much as 50dB greater than sound pressures typically generated while listening to sounds in an open environment. Even at moderate listening volumes, the TVIG can increase the low frequency SPL in the ear canal to levels where they produce excursions of the tympanic membrane that are 100 to 1000 times greater than in normal open-ear hearing. Additionally, the high SPL at low frequencies in the trapped volume of the ear canal, can easily exceed the threshold necessary to trigger the Stapedius reflex, a stiffing response of the middle ear, which reduces its sensitivity, and may lead to audio fatigue. The addition of a compliant membrane covered vent in the sound tube of an insert ear tip was found to reduce the TVIG by up to 20 dB, such that the Stapedius reflex would likely not be triggered.},

abstract = {We design a numerical algorithm for wave simulation in anelastic media in the presence of free surface, which can be used to model seismic waves at the Earth's surface and ultrasonic waves in heterogeneous materials. The stress-strain relation is based on the Kelvin-Voigt mechanical model, which has the advantage of not requiring additional field variables. The model requires two anelastic parameters and twice the spatial derivatives of the lossless case. The high-frequency components of the wave field are more attenuated than the low-frequency components, with the attenuation factors being approximately proportional to the square of the frequency. The modeling simulates 3-D waves by using the Fourier and Chebyshev methods to compute the spatial derivatives along the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. We stretch the mesh in the vertical direction to increase the minimum grid spacing and reduce the computational cost. Instabilities of the Chebyshev differential operator due to the implementation of the free-surface boundary conditions are solved with a characteristic approach, where the characteristic variables are evaluated at the source central frequency. The results of the modeling are verified by comparisons to the analytical solutions for Lamb's problem and propagation in unbounded homogeneous media. Examples illustrating the propagation of Rayleigh and Love waves are presented. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Since publication of the first edition in 1973, this professional and scientific reference has become the standard work in the field, providing detailed analysis of the state of the art in room acoustics.It outlines the theory and practice of sound behaviour in enclosed spaces. Particular emphasis is given to the properties and calculation of reverberation, the most obvious acoustical feature of a closed room. Further key topics include the mechanisms of sound absorption and psychoacoustical factors, from which design parameters and figures of merit are derived. Two chapters are devoted to practical questions such as measurement techniques and the procedures of room acoustical design. The interaction between a room's acoustic properties and its electroacoustic systems is also considered, and refined systems for optimizing listening conditions in a room are presented. This edition includes a new list of symbols, and updated sections include the measurement of the impulse response including a discussion of distortions, sound propagation as a diffusive process and scattering by wall irregularities.},

abstract = {A two variable model with delay in both the variables, is proposed for the circadian oscillations of protein concentrations in the fungal species Neurospora crassa. The dynamical variables chosen are the concentrations of FRQ and WC-1 proteins. Our model is a two variable simplification of the detailed model of Smolen et al. (J. Neurosci. 21 (2001) 6644) modeling circadian oscillations with interlocking positive and negative feedback loops, containing 23 variables. In our model, as in the case of Smolen's model, a sustained limit cycle oscillation takes place in both FRQ and WC-1 protein in continuous darkness, and WC-1 is anti-phase to FRQ protein, as observed in experiments. The model accounts for various characteristic features of circadian rhythms such as entrainment to light dark cycles, phase response curves and robustness to parameter variation and molecular fluctuations. Simulations are carried out to study the effect of periodic forcing of circadian oscillations by lightdark cycles. The periodic forcing resulted in a rich bifurcation diagram that includes quasiperiodicity and chaotic oscillations, depending on the magnitude of the periodic changes in the light controlled parameter. When positive feedback is eliminated, our model reduces to the generic one dimensional delay model of Lema et al. (J. Theor. Biol. 204 (2000) 565), delay model of the circadian pace maker with FRQ protein as the dynamical variable which represses its own production. This one-dimensional model also exhibits all characteristic features of circadian oscillations and gives rise to circadian oscillations which are reasonably robust to parameter variations and molecular noise.},

abstract = {This paper considers source excitation strategies in finite difference time domain room acoustics simulations for auralization purposes. We demonstrate that FDTD simulations can be conducted to obtain impulse responses based on unit impulse excitation, this being the shortest, simplest and most efficiently implemented signal that might be applied. Single, rather than double, precision accuracy simulations might be implemented where memory use is critical but the consequence is a remarkably increased noise floor. Hard source excitation introduces a discontinuity in the simulated acoustic field resulting in a shift of resonant modes from expected values. Additive sources do not introduce such discontinuities, but instead result in a broadband offset across the frequency spectrum. Transparent sources address both of these issues and with unit impulse excitation the calculation of the compensation filters required to implement transparency is also simplified. However, both transparent and additive source excitation demonstrate solution growth problems for a bounded space. Any of these approaches might be used if the consequences are understood and compensated for, however, for room acoustics simulation the hard source is the least favorable due to the fundamental changes it imparts on the underlying geometry. These methods are further tested through the implementation of a directional sound source based on multiple omnidirectional point sources. ?? 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic genomic information is modulated by a variety ofepigenetic modifications that play both a direct role in establishing transcription profiles, modulation of DNA replication and repair processes and also indirect effects on the aforementioned processes through the organization of DNA architecture within the cell nucleus. Nowadays, the role of epigenetic modifications in regulating tissue-specific expression, genomic imprinting or X-chromosome inactivation is widely recognized. In addition, the key role of epigenetic modifications during cell differentiation and development has been highlighted by the identification of a variety of epigenetic alterations in human disease. Particular attention has been focused on the study of epigenetic alterations in cancer, which is the subject of intense multidisciplinary efforts and has an impact not only in understanding the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation but also in guiding the development ofnovel therapies for cancer treatment. In addition, a number of genetic disorders such as immunodeficiency-centromere instability-facial anomalies (ICF) or Rett syndromes are directly associated with defects in elements of the epigenetic machinery. More recently, epigenetic changes in cardiovascular, neurological and autoimmune disorders as well as in other genetically complex diseases have also started to emerge. All these examples illustrate the widespread association ofepigenetic alterations with disease and highlight the need of characterizing the range and extension of epigenetic changes to understand their contribution to fundamental human biological processes.},

Geometric room acoustic modelling methods were employed to realise this aim and particular attention was given to monitoring the influ- ence of the level of geometrical detailing on acoustical character- istics. Three virtual acoustic models, of varying detail, were con- structed and simulated in order to obtain room impulse responses which were then harnessed for analysis and the creation of au- ralizations. The results given in this document were obtained through direct examination of impulse responses gathered and subjective testing. Reverberation times were shown to be more or less consistent at high frequencies in all three models and in- creasingly dissimilar as frequency decreases. Subjective testing was employed to gain insight into the audibility of the contrast in acoustical qualities possessed by each model. The conclusions drawn from analysis are, in part, supported by the subjective test- ing results},

Neurosci. 21 (2001) 6644) modeling circadian oscillations with interlocking positive and negative feedback loops, containing 23 variables. In our model, as in the case of Smolen's model, a sustained limit cycle oscillation takes place in both FRQ and WC-1 protein in continuous darkness, and WC-1 is anti-phase to FRQ protein, as observed in experiments. The model accounts for various characteristic features of circadian rhythms such as entrainment to light dark cycles, phase response curves and robustness to parameter variation and molecular fluctuations. Simulations are carried out to study the effect of periodic forcing of circadian oscillations by lightdark cycles. The periodic forcing resulted in a rich bifurcation diagram that includes quasiperiodicity and chaotic oscillations, depending on the magnitude of the periodic changes in the light controlled parameter. When positive feedback is eliminated, our model reduces to the generic one dimensional delay model of Lema et al. (J. Theor. Biol. 204 (2000) 565), delay model of the circadian pace maker with FRQ protein as the dynamical variable which represses its own production. This one-dimensional model also exhibits all characteristic features of circadian oscillations and gives rise to circadian oscillations which are reasonably robust to parameter variations and molecular noise.},

abstract = {Investigation of wafer spatial variations is critical for semiconductor process/equipment optimization and circuit design. The objective of spatial variation study is to differentiate the systematic variation component from the random component. This is usually done by contrasting with a set of known systematic patterns based on engineering knowledge. However, there could exist unknown systematic components remaining in the unexplained residuals and overlooked by the conventional spatial variation study. In this paper, we develop a novel spatial variance spectrum (SVS) to analyze the systematic variations without any priori information of the systematic patterns. The SVS is a series of spatial variations over a range of spatial moving window sizes from the smallest spatial moving window consisting of only two metrology sites to the largest one covering all metrology sites of the entire wafer. The SVS can be used to characterize the wafer spatial variations and to detect existence of systematic variations by a proposed hypothesis test. We also propose an index to summarize from the SVS the systematic proportion of the spatial variation. The proposed test and index of systematic variations will be demonstrated and validated through both hypothetical examples and actual cases of wafer critical dimension (CD) metrology data.},

abstract = {The subjective evaluation of the auralization of a simulated acoustic environment, with a view to establishing the success or otherwise of the results obtained, is usually best achieved using listening tests comparing the virtual environment with the actual measured space. As existing modelling methods still need to be improved, it is of critical importance to focus on the human perception of the acoustic of the given space, rather than optimizing room acoustic parameters based only on objective measures. This work uses a much simplified representation of a space with the resulting computer model giving the capability to control all of the examined acoustic or simulation parameters independently. A 3D shoebox-shape room is created and a variety of factors are changed in order to investigate their relevance and influence on human perception. These results are obtained from listening tests and conclusions for the psychoacoustic perception of such a space are given.},

abstract = {Reduction of noise is one of the multiple benefits of building envelope greening measures. The potential of wall vegetation systems, green roofs, vegetated low screens at roof edges, and also combinations of such treatments, have been studied by means of combining 2D and 3D full-wave numerical methodologies. This study is concerned with road traffic noise propagation towards the traffic-free sides of inner-city buildings (courtyards). Preserving quietness at such locations has been shown before to be beneficial for the health and well-being of citizens. The results in this study show that green roofs have the highest potential to enhance quietness in courtyards. Favourable combinations of roof shape and green roofs have been identified. Vegetated fa{\c{c}}ades are most efficient when applied to narrow city canyons with otherwise acoustically hard fa{\c{c}}ade materials. Greening of the upper storey's in the street and (full) fa{\c{c}}ades in the courtyard itself is most efficient to achieve noise reduction. Low-height roof screens were shown to be effective when multiple screens are placed, but only on conditions that their faces are absorbing. The combination of different greening measures results in a lower combined effect than when the separate effects would have been linearly added. The combination of green roofs or wall vegetation with roof screens seems most interesting. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Novel FDTD formulations of simple locally reacting wall models with complex impedance are proposed and analysed in terms of pressure wave reflectance for different wall impedances and angles of incidence. The analysis is done using both numerical experiments and analytic evaluation. For the numerical experiments, a compact implicit scheme of 4th-order accuracy is used for updating the room interior grid points, the results of which are analysed in both time and frequency domains. The simulation results show that the 2D frequency-dependent locally reacting wall models adhere well to their theoretical counterparts, particularly at low frequencies. Furthermore, they validate the analytic evaluation method, which paves the way for using either method as a tool for analysis of numerical reflectance.},

abstract = {Large-scale simulations of ultrasonic waves in heterogeneous tissue models are useful in biomedical R{\{}{\&}{\}}D for imaging and therapeutics. The scale of bioacoustic models is hundreds of wavelengths. Typical 2D wave solvers are not practical at this scale, and 3D is out of the question, because of numerical errors and/or computer limits. To achieve much higher performance we use the periodic pseudospectral (PS) method, where spatial derivatives are calculated from FFTs over Cartesian grids. With a 4th order explicit time integrator, the PS method yields the necessary accuracy and efficiency. However, the domain must be periodic. We show how to circumvent this intrinsic limitation with Berenger's perfectly matched layer (PML) on the boundaries. High accuracy, computational efficiency, and parallelism are demonstrated and a large-scale bioacoustic model is calculated. Generalizations of the method are described, including attenuation and nonlinearity},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The subjective evaluation of the auralization of a simulated acoustic environment, with a view to establishing the success or otherwise of the results obtained, is usually best achieved using listening tests comparing the virtual environment with the actual measured space. As existing modelling methods still need to be improved, it is of critical importance to focus on the human perception of the acoustic of the given space, rather than optimizing room acoustic parameters based only on objective measures. This work uses a much simplified representation of a space with the resulting computer model giving the capability to control all of the examined acoustic or simulation parameters independently. A 3D shoebox-shape room is created and a variety of factors are changed in order to investigate their relevance and influence on human perception. These results are obtained from listening tests and conclusions for the psychoacoustic perception of such a space are given.},

The work is differentiated from the generic investigation of ‘sound quality' which is usually associated with studies of nonlinear distortion. The proposed hypothesis suggests that distortion products generated within the compressive type nonlinear system are able to act as loudness compensator for the associated amplitude compression in the loudness function. The hypothesis is tested using the Time-Varying Loudness model of Glasberg and Moore (2002) and further tested using AB scale hidden reference type listening test methods.

Y and Cu ions remain quantitatively at the substrate despite the heating procedure. A linear dependence between area density of the metal ions in the oxidized films and the number of monolayers of the LB films was observed. The preparation of a mixed metal-oxide film containing Y, Ba, Cu with a given stoichiometry was found to be difficult due to the effect of counter ion exchange. The samples were investigated by means of plasma-desorption and spontaneous-desorption mass spectrometry, by Rutherford back-scattering and electron microscopy.},

abstract = {Modal analysis of a rectangular room requires evaluation of the eigenvalues of the Helmholtz operator while taking into account the boundary conditions imposed on the walls of the room. When the walls have finite impedances, the acoustic eigenvalue equation becomes complicated and a numerical method that can find all roots within a given interval is required to solve it. In this study, the interval Newton/generalized bisection (IN/GB) method is adopted for solving this problem. For an efficient implementation of this method, bounds are derived for the acoustic eigenvalues and their asymptotic behavior explored. The accuracy of the IN/GB method is verified for a canonical problem by comparing the modal solution with the corresponding finite element solution. Furthermore, reverberation times estimated using the IN/GB rnethod are compared to those calculated using the finite difference method. Through these examples, it is demonstrated that the IN/GB method provides a useful and efficient approach for estimating the acoustic responses of rectangular rooms with finite wall impedances.

Mainly because it is a time-domain method, it has some specific advantages. The basic formulation of the FDTD method uses an analytical grid for the discretization of an unknown field. This is a major disadvantage. In this paper, FDTD equations that allow us to use a nonuniform grid are derived. With this grid, tilted and curved boundaries can be described more easily. This gives a better accuracy to CPU-resource ratio in a number of circumstances. The paper focuses on the new formulation and its accuracy. The problem of automatically generating the mesh in a general situation is not addressed. Simulations using quasi-Cartesian grids are compared to Cartesian grid results.},

In this paper, we review three higher order finite difference methods, higher order compact (HOC), compact Pad{\'{e}} based (CPD) and non-compact Pad{\'{e}} based (NCPD) schemes for the acoustic wave equation. We present the stability analysis of the three schemes and derive dispersion characteristics for these schemes.

@book{Billings2011,
abstract = {The “direct-off-line” switchmode supply is so called because it takes its power input directly from the ac power lines, without using the rather large low-frequency (60 to 50 Hz) isolation transformer normally found in linear power supplies. Although the various switchmode conversion techniques are often very different in terms of circuit design, they have, over many years, developed very similar basic functional characteristics that have become generally accepted industry standards. Further, the need to satisfy various national and international safety, electromagnetic compatibility, and line transient requirements has forced the adoption of relatively standard techniques for track and component spacing, noise filter design, and transient protection. The prudent designer will be familiar with all these agency needs before proceeding with a design. Many otherwise sound designs have failed as a result of their inability to satisfy safety agency standards. Many of the requirements outlined in this section will be common to all switching sup-plies, irrespective of the design strategy or circuit. Although the functions tend to remain the same for all units, the circuit techniques used to obtain them may be quite different. There are many ways of meeting these needs, and there will usually be a best approach for a particular application. The designer must also consider all the minor facets of the specification before decid-ing on a design strategy. Failure to consider at an early stage some very minor system requirement could completely negate a design approach—for example, power good and power failure indicators and signals, which require an auxiliary supply irrespective of the converter action, would completely negate a design approach which does not provide this auxiliary supply when the converter is inhibited! It can often prove to be very difficult to provide for some minor neglected need at the end of the design and development exercise. The remainder of Chap. 1 gives an overview of the basic input and output functions most often required by the user or specified by national or international standards. They will assist in the checking or development of the initial specification, and all should be considered before moving to the design stage.},

abstract = {This textbook is aimed at newcomers to nonlinear dynamics and chaos, especially students taking a first course in the subject. The presentation stresses analytical methods, concrete examples and geometric intuition. The theory is developed systematically, starting with first-order differential equations and their bifurcations, followed by phase plane analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations, and culminating with the Lorenz equations, chaos, iterated maps, period doubling, renormalization, fractals, and strange attractors.A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on applications. These include mechanical vibrations, lasers, biological rhythms, superconducting circuits, insect outbreaks, chemical oscillators, genetic control systems, chaotic waterwheels, and even a technique for using chaos to send secret messages. In each case, the scientific background is explained at an elementary level and closely integrated with the mathematical theory.Richly illustrated, and with many exercises and worked examples, this book is ideal for an introductory course at the junior/senior or first-year graduate level. It is also ideal for the scientist who has not had formal instruction in nonlinear dynamics, but who now desires to begin informal study. The prerequisites are multivariable calculus and introductory physics.},

First, a general introduction of the sound propagation principles and a discussion of the state of the art in room acoustics modeling are given. How to implement the ray-tracing algorithm is explained, not only the way adopted by the author but also other possibilities which could improve accuracy. That is followed by a geometrical and an acoustical description of the three studied enclosures, and the comparison of the modeled and measured data. Sound pressure level is predicted with very good accuracy, while reverberation time is more contradictory due to the negation of the wave nature of sound which is inherent in the model. The paper ends with a discussion of the results' accuracy and the reasons for similarities and/or differences.},

abstract = {A synthesis of two newly developed concepts in 3-D modeling is developed in this paper: (1) The open. (non complete) seismic model, and (2) the ray tracing based wavefront (WF) construction method. The open model may contain interfaces with holes and other missing parts, which simplifies model building considerably because the input horizon data from standard interpretation and processing packages are often incomplete. A set of volumes is defined in the model. A volume is a logical unit that points to a set of property functions, e.g., P-velocity, S-velocity, and density. The properties are represented either as constants or as B-spline functions of the spatial coordinates (x, y) or (x, y, z). The volumes of the model are assigned to opposing sides of each interface and not to specific spatial areas of the model, which is the case in most (blocky) model representations. The interfaces are given explicitly by triangular grids where the sizes of the triangles are determined locally by the curvature of the interface.|We show how modeling by WF construction is both possible and computationally efficient in open models, but only after some modifications to deal with the ambiguity of the model representation. It is not possible to find a unique volume for the spatial positions in an open model. Instead, the volumes (with associated velocities, etc.) are determined from the last interface encountered by each ray in the WE To find an arrival in a receiver, the volume associated to the receiver has to match the volume of the WF hitting the receiver.},

@article{Zhang2010,
abstract = {The explosion of interest in metamaterials is due to the dramatically increased manipulation ability over light as well as sound waves. This material research was stimulated by the opportunity to develop an artificial media with negative refractive index and the application in superlens which allows super-resolution imaging. High-resolution acoustic imaging techniques are the essential tools for nondestructive testing and medical screening. However, the spatial resolution of the conventional acoustic imaging methods is restricted by the incident wavelength of ultrasound. This is due to the quickly fading evanescent fields which carry the subwavelength features of objects. By focusing the propagating wave and recovering the evanescent field, a flat lens with negative-index can potentially overcome the diffraction limit. We present the first experimental demonstration of focusing ultrasound waves through a flat acoustic metamaterial lens composed of a planar network of subwavelength Helmholtz resonators. We observed a tight focus of half-wavelength in width at 60.5 KHz by imaging a point source. This result is in excellent agreement with the numerical simulation by transmission line model in which we derived the effective mass density and compressibility. This metamaterial lens also displays variable focal length at different frequencies. Our experiment shows the promise of designing compact and light-weight ultrasound imaging elements. ii Moreover, the concept of metamaterial extends far beyond negative refraction, rather giving enormous choice of material parameters for different applications. One of the most interesting examples these years is the invisible cloak. Such a device is proposed to render the hidden object undetectable under the flow of light or sound, by guiding and controlling the wave path through an engineered space surrounding the object. However, the cloak designed by transformation optics usually calls for a highly anisotropic metamaterial, which make the experimental studies remain challenging. We present here the first practical realization of a low-loss and broadband acoustic cloak for underwater ultrasound. This metamaterial cloak is constructed with a network of acoustic circuit elements, namely serial inductors and shunt capacitors. Our experiment clearly shows that the acoustic cloak can effectively bend the ultrasound waves around the hidden object, with reduced scattering and shadow. Due to the non-resonant nature of the building elements, this low loss ({\~{}}6dB/m) cylindrical cloak exhibits excellent invisibility over a broad frequency range from 52 to 64 kHz in the measurements. The low visibility of the cloaked object for underwater ultrasound shed a light on the fundamental understanding of manipulation, storage and control of acoustic waves. Furthermore, our experimental study indicates that this design approach should be scalable to different acoustic frequencies and offers the possibility for a variety of devices based on coordinate transformation.},

Some weaknesses in the quadrifontal approach are discussed, and difficulties in meaningfully testing systems are mentioned. It is observed that the ultimate aim of surround systems is toprovide a good illusion of an intended encoded directional effect, and that this aim is not dependent on any particular choice of number of channels, number or position of loudspeakers, or on any particular method of originating surround program material. An appendix describes the similarities and differences between the resultant "kernel" system approach and the current matrix approach.},

abstract = {A single room impulse response can reveal information about the acoustics of a given space in both objective, and, when used for auralization, subjective terms. However, for additional spatial information, or more accurate and perceptually convincing auralization, multiple impulse responses are needed. Higher order Ambisonics is a robust means of capturing the spatial qualities of an acoustic space over multiple channels for decoding and rendering over many possible speaker layouts. A method for obtaining {\$}N{\$}th-order Ambisonic impulse responses from a room acoustic model, based on lower orders using differential microphone techniques is presented. This is tested using a third-order encoding of a 2-D finite difference time domain room acoustic simulation based on multiple circular arrays of receivers. Accurate channel directional profiles are obtained and results are verified in a series of listening tests comparing the localization of a sound source placed within the given simulation to the same source encoded directly. This generic encoding scheme can be applied to any room acoustic simulation technique where it is possible to obtain impulse responses across multiple receiver positions. Although the proposed method encompasses horizontal encoding only, it can also be applied directly in 3-D simulations where height information is not required in the final auralization.},

The original version of this program was developed by Frank Mittelbach to accompany his doc.sty which enables literate programming in LATEX. Denys Duchier rewrote it to run either with TEX or with LATEX, and to allow full boolean expressions in conditional guards instead of just comma-separated lists. Johannes Braams re-united the two implementations, documented and debugged the code. In September 1995 Marcin Woli{\{}{\'{n}}{\}}ski changed many parts of the program to make use of TEX's ability to write to multiple files at the same time to avoid re-reading sources. The performance improvement of version 2.3 came at a price of compatibility with some more obscure operating systems which limit the number of files a process can keep open. This was corrected in September 1996 by Mark Wooding and his changes were “creatively merged” by Marcin Woli{\{}{\'{n}}{\}}ski who made at the same time changes in batch files processing, handling of preambles and introduced “verbatim mode”. After all that, David Carlisle merged the new version into the LATEX sources, and made a few other changes, principally making DocStrip work under initex, and removing the need for batch files to say {\$}\backslash{\$}def{\$}\backslash{\$}batchfile{\{}{\{}{\}}...{\{}{\}}{\}}.},

abstract = {The Fourier pseudospectral time-domain method is an efficient wave-based method to model sound propagation in inhomogeneous media. One of the limitations of the method for atmospheric sound propagation purposes is its restriction to a Cartesian grid, confining it to staircase-like geometries. A transform from the physical coordinate system to the curvilinear coordinate system has been applied to solve more arbitrary geometries. For applicability of this method near the boundaries, the acoustic velocity variables are solved for their curvilinear components. The performance of the curvilinear Fourier pseudospectral method is investigated in free field and for outdoor sound propagation over an impedance strip for various types of shapes. Accuracy is shown to be related to the maximum grid stretching ratio and deformation of the boundary shape and computational efficiency is reduced relative to the smallest grid cell in the physical domain. The applicability of the curvilinear Fourier pseudospectral time-domain method is demonstrated by investigating the effect of sound propagation over a hill in a nocturnal boundary layer. With the proposed method, accurate and efficient results for sound propagation over smoothly varying ground surfaces with high impedances can be obtained.},

abstract = {Modal analysis of a rectangular room requires evaluation of the eigenvalues of the Helmholtz operator while taking into account the boundary conditions imposed on the walls of the room. When the walls have finite impedances, the acoustic eigenvalue equation becomes complicated and a numerical method that can find all roots within a given interval is required to solve it. In this study, the interval Newton/generalized bisection (IN/GB) method is adopted for solving this problem. For an efficient implementation of this method, bounds are derived for the acoustic eigenvalues and their asymptotic behavior explored. The accuracy of the IN/GB method is verified for a canonical problem by comparing the modal solution with the corresponding finite element solution. Furthermore, reverberation times estimated using the IN/GB rnethod are compared to those calculated using the finite difference method. Through these examples, it is demonstrated that the IN/GB method provides a useful and efficient approach for estimating the acoustic responses of rectangular rooms with finite wall impedances.

It is a quantitative tool by which the leachate pollution data of landfill sites can be reported uniformly. LPI is an increasing scale index and has been formulated based on the Delphi technique. It provides a convenient means of summarizing complex leachate pollution data and facilitates its communication to the general public, field professionals and policy makers. However, it is observed that the LPI, like any other environmental index, fails to effectively communicate the details about the strength of various pollutants/pollutant groups present. In an effort to make the LPI more informative and useful, it is proposed to divide the LPI into three sub-indices. The aggregation of these three sub-LPIs will result in the overall LPI. The formulation and the application of LPI and its three sub-indices are presented in this paper. It has been concluded that the splitting of LPI into three sub-indices provides a better insight on the strength of various pollutants and can be useful to the experts in deciding various management issues regarding leachate treatment. The leachate characteristics of a UK landfill have been used as a case study to demonstrate the calculation of three sub-LPIs and the overall LPI.},

And yet, standard meas-urements of the random incidence absorption coefficient, according to ISO 354 and ASTM C423-09, are still inaccurate and lack reproducibility among labs. All measurements and predictions rely on the concept of a diffuse sound field, which is yet to be fully characterized in the standards. Research is underway to improve accuracy by replacing traditional hang-ing diffusors with boundary mounted diffusors, to allow proper determination of the rev room's surface area and volume, evaluating edge diffraction, replacing Sabine with Eyring, etc.. Calibration methods using an absorptive or reflective refer-ence are also being evaluated to improve reproducibility. This author favors the use of a reflective reference, as this is cur-rently being used in ISO 179497-1 and ISO 17497-2 and reproducibility is found to be quite good at various scales among different labs. The field of measuring and characterizing scattered sound is in its infancy by comparison, yet in the past three decades much progress has been made. Two standards have emerged for measuring scattering (ISO 17497-1) and diffusion (ISO-17497-2) and the current state of the art for both will be reviewed. While much progress has been made in measuring and characterizing scattering surfaces, we still need to develop a relationship between these material metrics and a room property, which we can call diffusivity. This paper is intended to be a tutorial on the evolution and current state of the art.},

The five NLDs are half-wave rectifier, full-wave rectifier, square wave, polynomial function and exponential function. The derivation of harmonic analysis equations are based on Fourier Theorems, Chebyshev Polynomials, and Taylor Series expansions. Besides the harmonics, intermodulation components are also resulted from NLDs. Both mathematical analysis and simulation results are presented for the intermodulation effects of harmonics generated by NLDs.},

Earlier studies reveal that although objective measurement scores quantify bass enhancement and harmonic distortion, there is weak correlationwith subjective perception. An in-depth sub- jective study is presented on NLD-specific distortion linked to perception and bass-intensity enhancement and then extended to correlate the Rnonlin distortion model to subjective data. Nonlinear regression computes Rnonlin-equation coefficients to enable a metric for audibility of NLD-dependent distortion. Recommendations follow for NLD sets that achieve good bass performance with low perceived distortion.},

abstract = {The finite-difference time-domain method is a simple but powerful numerical method for simulating full-wave acoustic propagation and scattering. However, the method can demand a large amount of computational resources. Traditionally, continuously curved boundaries are represented in a stair-step fashion and thus accurately modeling scattering from a boundary will require a finer discretization than would otherwise be necessary for modeling propagation in a homogeneous medium. However, a fine discretization might not be practical due to limited computational resources. A locally conformal technique is presented here for modeling acoustic scattering from continuously curved rigid boundaries. This technique is low cost, simple to implement, and gives better results for the same grid discretization than the traditional stair-step representation. These improvements can be traded for a coarser discretization which reduces the computational burden. The improved accuracy of this technique is demonstrated for a spherical scatterer.},

Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) methods, operating over regular grids, are perhaps the best known among such methods, which simulate the acoustic field in its entirety over the problem domain. In a realistic room acoustics setting, working over a regular grid is attractive from a computational standpoint, but is complicated by geometrical considerations, particularly when the geometry does not conform neatly to the grid, and those of boundary conditions which emulate the properties of real wall materials. Both such features may be dealt with through an appeal to methods operating over unstructured grids, such as finite volume methods, which reduce to FDTD when employed over regular grids. Through numerical energy analysis, such methods lead to direct stability conditions for complex problems, including convenient geometrical conditions at irregular boundaries. Simulation results are presented.},

Elastic properties and viscous effects are taken into account. From the bouncing spring equations of motion, we emphasize the relevant parameters of the dynamics. We discuss the range of parameters in which elastic deformations do not influence the bouncing dynamics of this object and compare this behavior with the bouncing ball dynamics. By calculating the spring bouncing threshold, we evidence the effect of resonance and prove that elastic properties can make the bounce easier. This effect is for example encountered in the case of bouncing droplets. We also consider bifurcation diagrams in order to describe the consequences of a dependence on the frequency. Finally, hysteresis in the dynamics is presented. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli is the most frequent pathogen in both acute bacterial prostatitis and acute uncomplicated urinary infections. To assess the virulence profiles of E. coli in acute prostatitis, the serotypes and virulence factor (VF) genotypes were determined. METHODS: We studied 107 E. coli isolates from cases of acute bacterial prostatitis, 76 isolates from acute pyelonephritis, 194 isolates from acute Cystitis and 80 fecal isolates from healthy people. All pyelonephritis and cystitis isolates were from women. Seven urovirulence determinants were analyzed by DNA colony hybridization, including the genes for type 1 fimbria (pil), P fimbria (pap), S fimbria (sfa), afimbrial adhesin AFA-I (afaI), alpha-hemolysin (hly), cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1) and aerobactin (aer). O:H:K serotypes were also determined. RESULTS: With the exception of pil and afaI, all VFs were significantly more often associated with prostatitis, pyelonephritis and cystitis isolates than with the fecal isolates. The prevalence of sfa, hly and cnf1 was higher in prostatitis isolates than in pyelonephritis and cystitis isolates, and the pap+sfa+hly+cnf1+ genotype was dominant among prostatitis isolates (48.8{\%}). Nine O serotype (O1, O2, O4, O6, O16, O18, O22, O25 and O75) accounted for 79.4{\%}, 73.7{\%} and 78.4{\%} of the prostatitis, pyelonephritis and cystitis strains, respectively. There was an apparent correlation between serotype and genotype in uropathogenic E. coli. CONCLUSION: The predominance of O serotypes in female urinary tract infections and a high percentage of multiple VFs among the prostatitis isolates suggested that VFs play important roles in the pathogenesis of acute bacterial prostatitis.},

abstract = {The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is a simple but powerful numerical method which has been used to perform a wide variety of complex simulations. One of the considerations in using this method is modeling the source of the incident field. When the physical source of acoustic energy is located within the FDTD grid it has typically been modeled as a ‘‘hard'' source for which a source function determines the field at a source node. One drawback of a hard source is that it acts itself as a scatterer. Moreover, its scattering cross section is dictated by the spatial step size within the grid; thus, scattering is independent of the underlying physical size of the source. In this paper a scheme is presented that permits the creation of completely transparent sources. These sources, although more expensive to implement than traditional hard sources, radiate the same field as a hard source, but do not scatter energy.},

Our study analyzed the long-term results and patient satisfaction following a percutaneous release in 30 joints after a mean follow-up period of 34 months. In one half of cases the preoperative joint flexion deformity was reduced from 78° to 34°. The best results were observed in patients with osteoarthritis and stiff, immobilized joints. In patients with inflammatory arthritides, marked intraoperative correction was maintained rarely, joint contractures recurred early, and patients were unsatisfied. There were no intraoperative complications. Percutaneous release of the accessory collateral ligaments can produce a long lasting correction of the joint contracture, but careful patient selection and strict postoperative rehabilitation are essential for favorable outcome.},

abstract = {Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) acoustic simulation was used to calculate Pinna-Related Transfer Functions (PRTFs) of the KEMAR manikin's DB60 pinna. A baseline set of 25 PRTFs were first calculated at regular intervals of elevation angle in the front median plane. The simulation was then repeated 1784 times, corresponding to every unique, single-voxel perturbation of the pinna's outer surface geometry. All perturbed PRTFs were compared with the baseline set, in order to precisely quantify the frequency shifts in all the spectral peaks and notches up to 14 kHz. This paper focuses on the pinna sensitivity patterns for the first spectral notch N1, known to be an auditory cue to elevation in the median plane. In particular, N1 sensitivity patterns revealed the elevation dependence of broad areas of the pinna's upper structures that are involved in reflection, and the role of the tragus region involved in diffraction.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic genomic information is modulated by a variety ofepigenetic modifications that play both a direct role in establishing transcription profiles, modulation of DNA replication and repair processes and also indirect effects on the aforementioned processes through the organization of DNA architecture within the cell nucleus. Nowadays, the role of epigenetic modifications in regulating tissue-specific expression, genomic imprinting or X-chromosome inactivation is widely recognized. In addition, the key role of epigenetic modifications during cell differentiation and development has been highlighted by the identification of a variety of epigenetic alterations in human disease. Particular attention has been focused on the study of epigenetic alterations in cancer, which is the subject of intense multidisciplinary efforts and has an impact not only in understanding the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation but also in guiding the development ofnovel therapies for cancer treatment. In addition, a number of genetic disorders such as immunodeficiency-centromere instability-facial anomalies (ICF) or Rett syndromes are directly associated with defects in elements of the epigenetic machinery. More recently, epigenetic changes in cardiovascular, neurological and autoimmune disorders as well as in other genetically complex diseases have also started to emerge. All these examples illustrate the widespread association ofepigenetic alterations with disease and highlight the need of characterizing the range and extension of epigenetic changes to understand their contribution to fundamental human biological processes.},

abstract = {A technique based on the combination of Fourier pseudospectral method and the perfectly matched layer (PML) is developed to simulate transient acoustic wave propagation in multidimensional, inhomogeneous, absorptive media. Instead of the finite difference approximation in the conventional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, this technique uses trigonometric functions, through an FFT (fast Fourier transform) algorithm, to represent the spatial derivatives in partial differential equations. Traditionally the Fourier pseudospectral method is used only for spatially periodic problems because the use of FFT implies periodicity. In order to overcome this limitation, the perfectly matched layer is used to attenuate the waves from other periods, thus allowing the method to be applicable to unbounded media. This new algorithm, referred to as the pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) algorithm, is developed to solve large-scale problems for acoustic waves. It has an infinite order of accuracy in the spatial derivatives, and thus requires much fewer unknowns than the conventional FDTD method. Numerical results confirms the efficacy of the PSTD method.},

This can take every detail of the acoustic space into account, including the speaker or headphone-to-ear transfer function. The model can be implemented in real time, with no extraneous latency, using Lake's Huron convolution tech- niques.

In this method, evaluation of spatial derivatives is based on an eigenfunction expansion. Evaluation on a spatial grid requires only two spatial points per wavelength. Time iteration is done using a low-storage optimized six-stage Runge-Kutta method. This method is applied to two-dimensional non-moving media models, one with screens and one for an urban canyon, with generally high accuracy in both amplitude and phase. For a moving atmosphere, accurate results have been obtained in models with both a uniform and a logarithmic wind velocity profile over a rigid ground surface and in the presence of a screen. The method has also been validated for three-dimensional sound propagation over a screen. For that application, the developed method is in the order of 100 times faster than the second-order-accurate FDTD solution to the linearized Euler equations. The method is found to be well suited for atmospheric sound propagation simulations where effects of complex meteorology and straight rigid boundary surfaces are to be investigated.},
