\chapter{Finite Difference Time Domain Method}

\abstract{The Finite Difference Time Domain Methods is a numerical method that can be used for solving partial differential equations. The power of this method lies in its simplicity and flexibility, and it can be used to solve partial differential equations of varying complexity. In this chapter we will discuss the application of the finite difference time domain method to the acoustic wave equation, including the application of empirical partially absorbing boundary conditions.}
