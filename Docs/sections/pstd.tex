\chapter{PseudoSpectral Time Domain Method}

\abstract{The Pseudo-spectral Time Domain Method [PSTD] is a numerical method that can be used for solving partial differential equations. The power of this method lies in leveraging the speed of performing a discrete Fourier transform, both providing fast frequency domain differentiation and differentiation with higher order accuracy than the FDTD method. In this chapter we will discuss the application of the finite difference time domain method to the acoustic wave equation, including the application of empirical partially absorbing boundary conditions.}
